Chapter 1.

The moment she opened the kitchen door, the smell of various ingredients and hot steam hit her. The maids were busy preparing lunch, not even having time to look back at who opened the door.
To be honest, there was no need to look back.

Because it was an ordinary maid who stepped into the kitchen, where the sound of knives and oil sizzled. A black maid’s uniform brushed the tip of her knees, a spotless white apron, and plain dark brown hair. It was a look as common as a crystal chandelier in the Winston mansion.

The maid picked up a wooden tray, a soup plate and a spoon from the cupboard. She went to the cupboard lined with colorful canned goods and picked up a white loaf and two boiled eggs from the basket, when someone spoke to her.

“Are the guests from the annex still there?”

The chef, Mrs. Appleby, clicked her tongue as she took the freshly baked meat pie out of the oven. The young maid, as usual, pretended to be sullen and pouted her lower lip slightly.

“That’s right. Still, I think they might go out today.”

“Tsk, tsk. Sally, you are really having a hard time.”

Mrs. Appleby placed the meat pie on a large table in the middle of the kitchen and held out her empty hand to the maid named Sally.

“Give it to me.”

The woman who took the empty soup bowl opened the large pot next to the stove, and when it had cooled down, she filled it with clam soup and placed it on Sally’s tray. The only thing floating in the bowl was crumpled scraps of ingredients.

“I can’t believe you’re doing that tough job without Ethel alone.”

Ethel was a middle-aged maid who, up until a month ago, was in charge of the ‘private room’ in the basement of the annex with Sally. She now dreamed of making a fortune with her husband, a gambler, and would be boarding on a ship heading to a new continent.

Although she felt sorry for Sally when she was left alone with the disgusting and reluctant job of all the employees of the Winston mansion, she never said she would help. So, Sally was relieved.

“Speak well to Mrs. Belmore—either she gets another person or gives you a higher salary.”

“Yes, I should see it.”

But, Sally was never going to get such a favor from the maid chief.

She then grabbed the tray and walked out the side door to the west of the mansion. A gravel path continued through the neatly mowed green grass. Before long, the annex, which seemed only small, became so close that the sharp barbed wire on the wall was clearly visible.

In the clear spring of cherry blossom leaves, the annex alone exuded the gloomy energy of winter. It was no wonder. It was like a haunted house over there, where screams resounded through the basement.

Sally wet her dry lips and raised the corners of her lips as she saw the soldiers standing guard at the front door of the outhouse.

“Hello, Martin.”

“Hello, Sally.”

The soldier she saw every day opened the iron door straight away without asking anything.

Sally walked slowly to the entrance to the annex, squinting every nook and cranny of the front yard. There was no car of the mansion’s owner, Captain Winston. It meant he hadn’t returned from the unit yet.

Great.

She went straight into the building and went down to the basement. She walked along the hallway to the left as if she was accustomed to it. The soldier who stood guarding the iron door in the middle of the hallway opened the door as soon as he saw Sally.

The strict security was threefold. In other words, there is one more group left to go through.

As she turned the corner to the right, two soldiers were sitting on chairs, chatting.

“Hello.”

“Hello, Sally.”

Across from the soldier, a black and crude iron gate was firmly locked. It was a place that exuded an aura that was far from the luxurious mansion annex.

“Did you two have dinner?”

Sally walked over to the soldiers and smiled, curling the corners of her eyes.

“No, we haven’t eaten yet”

The Private, who had the name ‘Fred Smith’ on his chest, received a squinting eye from the Corporal sitting next to him.

“I’ll get it from the main building soon.”

At the time of full hunger, a talk about a meal and the smell of soup wafted through, so there was no one who wouldn’t bite the bait.

“What’s on the menu today, Sally?”

“It’s meat pie. As soon as I opened the kitchen door, I could smell the fragrant smell. I was dripping with saliva.”

The Corporal’s hazy eyes flashed for an instant.

“Ah If I’m late again this time, won’t there be none?”

The Private, who had not yet taken off his boyish appearance, glanced at the Corporal and hinted. Then, he immediately gave Sally a daunting gaze. His eyes were like a puppy asking for praise, though she pretended not to see it and stared only at the Corporal’s face.

“Damn it I’m tired of consommé soup”

Those who did not know would say that a man who was tired of high-end cuisine knew nothing of gratitude.

Still, if they give a strong young man a soup with only chicken meatballs and a few pieces of vegetables for lunch, he couldn’t help but complain.

The practice of generously providing expensive meals to ordinary soldiers who were not officers was in fact rooted in the vanity and coldness of Mrs. Winston, and there was no reason to be grateful for Sally.

“I don’t think she cooked a lot You should go to the dining room quickly before it’s too late. I will lock the door.”

The Corporal made a troubled face as Sally shifted the tray into one of her hands and pulled a black key out of her pocket.

“The captain said I shouldn’t let Sally in alone”

There was a hint with just a tap from the blurry words that it would tilt to one side.

At that, Sally pricked her eyebrows as if she didn’t mind it, and she smiled.

“It’s okay. I don’t think the guest is violent. I’ll just leave the tray and bring the laundry and come out right away. Greg is out there as well.”

She glanced at the soldier who was guarding the iron gate over the corner. Only then did the Corporal pretend to reluctantly get up.

“Smith, let’s go.”

As the two men disappeared around the corner, Sally took the key to the heavy iron door. With a squeak, the door let out a sharp creak and retreated inside. The smell of fishy blood flowed out of the gap two spans wide.

Sally wet her dry lips again and placed her hand into the darkened room.

She immediately grabbed her switch in her hand. The next moment, all four lights turned on at the same time with a click, but the room didn’t get very bright. It was because the walls, as well as the floor and ceiling, were all black.

As the lights turned on, a middle-aged man crouching on a narrow bed on one wall trembled. Sally quickly entered the ‘private room,’ and she closed the door.

“Uncle, it’s me.”

The ‘guest in the private room,’ who had been hardening his whole body, let out a long sigh and relaxed. It was still blinding. Even though he hasn’t seen Sally’s face, he must have heard her voice.

The man’s appearance was no joke. She had seen countless times where lively faces dry and twisted like a corpse the moment they stepped into this room.

However, her heart hurt even more since the face was the village uncle she had known since childhood.

“I brought you food.”

She walked over to the little table at the foot of the bed.

Meanwhile, the man tried to get his body up, although he couldn’t even get up and groaned in pain. Placing the tray on the table, she quickly approached the man. Sally didn’t say anything while she supported him and sat him in the chair in front of the table.

She knew now because she had been through it many times

She knew that she could be a catalyst for cheap consolation to a person who was enduring all kinds of terrible torture with a thread of mind and stamina.

When she silently gave the spoon to him, she then began to peel the hard-boiled egg. The man couldn’t even do the simple task of cracking eggshells because he had all his nails pulled out.

“What happened last night? Last night there was a party in the main building, and I was called”

“Nothing, cough, cough.”

As the man started coughing, Sally poured water into a cup from the kettle on the table. He was still lucky, though because he was allowed one meal a day and water. There were times when they didn’t even give them water, let alone food.

His dry throat clenched, and the cough was quelled. Sally quickly pulled a vial out of her pocket before he picked up the spoon again.

“Eat this.”

It was an analgesic potion with morphine. As the man opened his mouth as if waiting, Sally let a drop of painkiller into his mouth.

She hid the vial again in her pocket and cracked the eggs. In the meantime, she kept talking to the man busy eating the soup. There was no time to wait until the meal was finished since they had to finish the conversation quickly before someone came in.

“You didn’t say anything at all, right?”

“.”

The man stopped his spoon and raised his head. There was fierce contempt in his eyes.

This happens every time.

Sally’s question to her colleague, who had been tortured for several days, was something she should be unwilling to ask. Was she interrogating? Was she monitoring? They could even make such an illusion.

Nonetheless, she couldn’t help it either. If there was any leaked information, she needed to know it as soon as possible to deal with it. It could endanger not only the uncle, but also the lives of others.

“You know you have to be honest with me, right?”

“Nothing.”

The man stared at Sally for a long time before bowing his head to the bowl of soup and spitting out the answer.

“I think we will move around today. I’ll send someone as soon as I find out where it is. So, never open your mouth and be patient. You know? People in the rescue team don’t want to know about failure”

It was the time when she poured out her last request.

Chapter 2.

The sound of blunt footsteps came from behind the torture chamber door. However, the time was too short for the two soldiers to have finished eating.

At that, Sally stopped and hurried to the bed. As she pulled off one side of the duvet stained with blood, the door swung open.

“Sally Bristol, what are you doing here?”

A voice that was as slow and soft as feathers fell sharply in her spine.

Why did Captain Winston return now, of all time?

Sally took the loosely removed duvet in her arms and looked back slowly. A young private was holding the wide-open door in a rigid posture.

A man with a light gray trench coat over his shoulders walked in between them without hesitation. Under the fluttering coat, a black officer’s uniform was hung straight, as if decorated with colorful medals.

Every time the medals were added one by one, she got sick of it. Because the stench of blood seemed to vibrate from the medal.

“Hello, Captain. I was giving lunch to the guests and packing up the laundry.”

She mixed a little bit of a curious look on her innocent face as though she didn’t know anything.

“You alone?”

“Yeah. Aunt Ethel quit a month ago”

“Ha”

Although Winston raised his lips softly and let out a low laugh, his ice-cold eyes were not smiling at all.

Facing him like that, Sally also had the urge to moisten her parched lips, but she resisted. It was because the other person would notice that she was nervous.

‘Has he not noticed already? There are many excuses to give if you ask me what kind of conversation we had’

As she rushed to plan all sorts of things inside her, she tilted her head, blinking her eyes and pretending to be puzzled on the outside.

Winston stood between the man at the table and her.

Sally felt a sense of intimidation as if she was facing a wall because of his large height and body.

He stared down at the man who had already begun shaking his hands for a moment with cold eyes and then took off his sharp look. His outstretched fingers that were as sharp as his eyes neatly swept over the blonde hair.

“I know that, Sally. You know that’s not what I mean.”

He pressed Sally lightly with a tone that seemed to appeal to a lover before suddenly turning around. The tip of a riding whip in his hand, clad in black leather gloves, pointed to the second lieutenant, who looked like his lieutenant.

“Campbell, get the men guarding the door right now.”

A terrifyingly low voice.

At that moment, in Sally’s head, the hallucination of that whip slashing through the air and tearing her flesh rang out.

She was standing like a prisoner against a wall with the duvet in her arms.

As Winston waited for the men, he glanced around as if seeing the torture chamber for the first time. Her spine shuddered as he lifted the chain hanging from Sally’s side and put it playfully in front of her neck.

If only she brought ‘it’ though she didn’t

“Captain, I have brought him.”

Sally sighed inside. She didn’t know whether she was relieved or frustrated.

The lips of the two soldiers glistened with grease as though they had been dragged in the midst of a meal. The Corporal took a salute position with a tense face. Meanwhile, the hand on his forehead was trembling slightly.

“Captain, did you call?”

“Right, why did I call you? Guess.”

Uttering lightly as if he was treating a friend, but no one took the situation lightly.

The Corporal’s eyes darted around the torture chamber with anxious eyes. What did he do wrong? The answer must be in this room. The moment he saw the maid who was standing on the wall, one step away from the Captain, he found the answer.

‘She said she’ll come in and out quickly, so why is she still here?’

He chewed the swear words to himself.

“You, you told me not to let the maid in alone.”

“Correct.”

Winston’s eyebrows curled loosely, but the tension in the torture chamber only grew tighter.

Swish. Swish.

The whip in his right hand sharply cut through the chilly air and lightly struck his left palm. Each time, the two soldiers trembled as if they had been hit.

“You have ears to listen to my instructions, though you don’t seem to understand because you don’t have a brain?”

“No, no—”

“Then, let me tell you why I told you not to let my Miss Sally Bristol in alone.”

Sally’s stomach churned.

Why did she become ‘Miss Sally Bristol’? It wasn’t just because of the overly gentlemanly title or an overly rude name.

The next moment, Winston came closer to her side and even grabbed her shoulder. From the place his hand touched to the waist of her back, her hairs stood upright. If it was another maid, how would they act?

Sally rolled her head quickly, biting her lower lip and placing a cold hand on one of her cheeks.

‘I hope that pretending to be shy works.’

She pretended not to see Private Fred Smith’s agitated eyes.

“That bastard”

The Corporal glanced at the man, who had hardened like a piece of wood in front of the table on the other side of the room, and looked again at the Captain politely.

“He said he might go into heat and could attack Sally.”

Sally? In heat? He didn’t even have the strength to lift a spoon—

Besides, Sally was a dull woman. Even though she looked pretty, she had no corners to arouse the lustful curiosity of a man. So therefore, the reason didn’t make sense.

Nonetheless, if the superior said so, it could not be helped.

“Sally, did you hear that?”

Winston finally took his hand from Sally’s shoulder. Though just as he was about to relax, his fingertips lifted the tip of her chin.

“This place is dangerous for a feeble lady.”

“Yes, I will be careful.”

Although she gave the answer he wanted right away, but he didn’t let go of her chin. He tilted her head at an angle as if kissing, as he gazed down at Sally.

‘You are more dangerous to me.’

This time she had to wet her parched lips.

As the tip of her tongue brushed against her lower lip, Winston wrinkled his brow slightly and pulled his hand from the tip of her chin.

“Did you guys hear it, too?”

He approached the soldiers who broke the rules.

“This place. Is dangerous. For feeble Sally.”

Every time he paused his words, the angular tips on the tip of the slender and flexible riding-whip pierced the soldiers’ stomach.

His voice gradually grew as fierce as the roar of an angry lion.

A cold sweat ran down Sally’s back. She was friends with Fred’s third older sister. Besides, she had been watching him since he was a baby, so she was scared that Fred, like a real younger brother, would be severely punished.

Sally bowed her head.

Soon, her shoulders trembled as she curled up like a frightened rabbit as tears fell from her big eyes.

“I’m, I’m sorry It’s because I came in. So, I will take the punishment for them, Captain.”

Quietly, she grabbed the hem of his trench coat and shook it.

“A man becomes a fool when a woman cries.”

That was what her mother said.

However, she said that it doesn’t work if she uses it too often, so she told her to do it in moderation.

Was he a man who couldn’t help but pay attention? Winston stopped the whip that had stabbed Fred in the chest, and he walked over to Sally.

“Sally, you don’t have to do this again. Huh? got it?”

“Sniff, yes”

She tried to wipe away the false tears with her sleeve, but he stopped them. Winston’s hand wrapped around her chin. Shortly, the straight-folded handkerchief gently pressed each tear print to dry it.

Everyone’s eyes widened at the not cold-blooded behavior. Their eyes widened with surprise as he stared down at the handkerchief drenched with the maid’s tears for a moment and then put it in the pocket of his jacket.

He was the one who threw the handkerchief on the floor once he had used it. Whereas this, was nothing else but a handkerchief soaked in bodily fluids of a lowly maid.

“Leave the meal outside from now on.”

“Yes, I will”

It was a moment when Sally was able to let her guard down with a voice that was as friendly as if teasing a child. Winston’s hand resting on her chin stopped in mid-air before he picked up the thumb of her left hand. His soft eyes set sharp in an instant.

Sally’s blood became cold as she followed his gaze.

A small piece of eggshell stuck under her fingernail.

He grinned at the pile of eggshells neatly laid out in front of the spy. His eyes were not smiling at all.

Winston’s close-cut fingernails dug under hers. The nails that had entered deep as if they were going to dig through her flesh were brutally twisted.

Sally held back a groan from the pain that crushed her delicate flesh. It was a bad habit for her to endure even when she didn’t need to because the training to endure the pain of torture was ingrained into her body.

Winston silently glanced down at the white shards adhering to the tip of his fingernails and tossed them off.

Cold words flew over her head along with the shells.

“Sally, you’re so kind that it bothers me.”

Chapter 3

While cleaning the annex office, tenacious gazes ran over Sally’s body. It felt like a cheap nylon brush was running through her body. The gaze became stinging for a moment as if she felt itchy from time to time.

Without realizing it, she shuddered.

“Captain, if I’m getting in the way, should I clean up later?”

She turned back and asked politely. Winston had just turned his gaze to the papers on his desk.

The tip of a cigar, sandwiched between his fingers, was chewed. He had a golden lighter in his other hand as though he had forgotten to light it.

“No, go ahead. I do my job, you do yours.”

Saying so, he looked down at the paperwork, spitting out the answer from the script in Sally’s head. She shouldn’t leave anyway, so she turned her back and moved the mop. The end of the chewed-up cigar kept running through her mind.

‘Did he imagine chewing something while looking at me?’

Suddenly, the tip of her chest hidden in the thin bra stung and tingled.

Dirty monarchy pig

Even though she wanted to leave right away, she couldn’t. It was because there was an important task left. What was reassuring was the fact that the two soldiers standing in front of the door were like statues.

She got up on the low chair and slowly wiped the bookshelf. Her calf, which got closer to his eye level, kept tickling.

‘Should I rather get rid of carpet stains on the back of the sofa?’

While she was thinking, someone knocked on the door.

With Winston’s permission, the door opened and Lieutenant Campbell walked in and saluted.

“Captain, the convoy to Govurn is said to be arriving at three o’clock.”

At the sound of a convoy coming to the camp, Sally was relieved. The uncle didn’t turn away. It was also her job to identify the spies in advance.

“Well There’s still time. We shouldn’t make our guest bored.”

‘Blood-crazed devil. May you fall down to the hell worthy of you.’

As she heard that there would be another torture, Sally cursed herself.

“Yes, I will prepare right away.”

As Campbell left, Sally walked over to Winston’s desk. It was an excuse to empty the ashtray, though that damn bastard still hadn’t lit his cigar. He just raised his gaze with his head still to the paperwork.

Sally smiled and picked up the tray of empty sparkling water bottles. On the way to the door with a bucket and a tray of cleaning tools, her heart stung once again.


The screams that had leaked out through the crack in the torture chamber’s door stopped. Then, Fred came out with a pale, blue face. He was clenching his teeth as if he was putting up with nausea. He took the prison uniform from Sally and went inside.
As she pulled a piece of cotton from her ear and put it in her pocket, the letter in the pocket rustled.

When the door opened again, she held a bucket full of cleaning tools in her hands. A group of soldiers poured out and bowed their heads to her. In the middle of it, there was an old man who was more emaciated than at lunch.

In the prison uniform, he was being dragged like cattle with shackles around his limp hands and feet.

Reading the horror in his trembling eyes, Sally gave a determined look on her face without a smile.

‘The rescue team will definitely come.’

When she saw the hem of the gray coat, she immediately drew her attention. Out of the torture chamber, Winston exuded the energy of a man coming out of a brothel or cabaret.

He had a fresh face, relieved of the accumulated desires.

“Then, I look forward to your cooperation today.”

As he tapped Sally on the shoulder and disappeared beyond the hallway, she immediately began cleaning the torture chamber.

The mattress had to be replaced every time a ‘guest’ left. Messed with blood and dirt, she put the mattress out in the hallway and whimpered while taking out a new mattress from the warehouse and putting it on the bed.

Managing the torture chamber was the most arduous and disgusting job in the mansion. Because of that, everyone was reluctant.

However, the weekly wage was also high.

For that reason, it was originally a middle-aged maid with a gambler husband, Ethel, who had been in charge of it for several years.

When Sally first infiltrated this mansion as the maid, she was assigned to attend to Mrs. Winston. Dress shopping, ladies’ refreshments, and Mrs. Winston’s whims and gossip Truly, as an agent, it had no beneficial value at all.

So, by the time she built her credibility as an excellent working child amongst the employees, she pretended to run out of money because of her ill mother.

Just as expected. The maid chief, Mrs. Bellmore, assigned her to the annex in a hurry. A maid who did her job well was precious, though a maid whose money was scarce was dangerous since Mrs. Winston’s dressing room was full of expensive things.

So, she got along with Ethel and took over the torture chamber, but Ethel started to get suspicious of Sally’s frequent sniffing.

[ “If you’re trying to win the Captain’s favor like that, then stop. Do you know how many children have been kicked out for arguing with the Captain so far?” ]

Fortunately, her original intention was completely undiscovered, though it was bothering the mission. Consequently, she used her head a bit and drove her away.

[ “My distant relative, an uncle, became crazy rich with it. How envious. Occasionally, when he comes to my hometown to play, he pays for my mother’s hospital bills, but I wondered where the old miser went. From the head to the toes, he was so dazzling” ]

Ethel, who lived on endless debt due to her gambler husband, eyes widened when she heard the story of a gold mine in the New World.

She wasn’t making it up very much. It was the truth that her aunt’s family got rich by the developing gold mining in the New World. She now lived in a big city over the ocean. Her aunt would occasionally send letters to Sally, asking her to live with her, but Sally refused each time.

Step on the weaker and climb higher and higher Accumulating blood-stained wealth, wears smooth clothes, and eats lavishly.

In a class made of money, they looked no different from the pigs of the monarchy.

The world that Sally’s deceased parents and moreover, the comrades whom she considered family dreamed of were not like that.

[ “The utopia will grow on the blood of the revolutionary army and bear fruit.” ]

Sally recalled the slogan, which she had chanted frequently since childhood. Literally, the blood of the revolutionary army was stuck between the black stone floors.

As she scraped it off with the brush, the letters in her pocket were rustling.

[ “I want Sally to be my daughter.” ]

Mrs. Appleby used to lament to Sally, who waited for her at 5 pm every day.

[ “My daughter only sends letters on Easter and Christmas.” ]

When the mail carriage came to the Winston mansion, she rushed to the door and held out a piece of letter. Mrs. Appleby thought it was a letter to her mother in the hospital. Only she and the postman, Peter, knew that the secret code to her comrade was actually hidden in the sweet and imaginative text.

Hidden in today’s letter was the message that the Uncle was moving to the Govurn camp.

The convoy has already left. Although she thought she should call the branch right away, the mansion’s phone could be tapped. The phone would be placed as soon as Peter returned to town.

It was a five-hour drive from here to the Govurn camp. In the meantime, there was enough time for the rescue team near Govurn to set up a rescue operation and wait. Perhaps, the uncle would return to the arms of his comrades before he even arrived in downtown Govurn.

Eventually, she came out of the torture chamber, which smelled of disinfectant and bleach.

Entering the hallway and turning the corner, there was a laundry chute that led up to the top floor of the annex. She opened the drawer and filled the basket with blood-soaked laundry.

As she was on her way to the laundry room in the main building with a full basket—

“Miss Bristol.”

At the sound of the voice suddenly pouring over her head, Sally missed the basket and the willow basket fell to the floor.

“Captain?”

When did he come? She couldn’t hear any footsteps.

She turned her head up, and the hot breath touched the back of her exposed neck.

Goosebumps welled up on Sally’s forearm.

The tip of his nose dug under the sparsely fine hair. Her legs trembled as Winston inhaled with his nose buried in her skin. She wanted to escape, but she was blocked by cold walls and the hot walls of blood and flesh.

“Sally, you smell good.”

All that came from her was the smell of blood and disinfectant.

He then took one step closer.

Sally’s heart, trapped between the wall in her mouth and between Winston’s chest, pounded in a thump.

‘Dangerous This is dangerous.’

A hard object pierced between her hips as she pushed the wall with her hands. It was easy to tell that it wasn’t a pistol. The heat that could not be stopped even with several layers of cloth warmed Sally’s delicate skin at will.

Chapter 4

‘Please, this way.’

The sound of military boots was heard from over the corner.

‘Please, come this way with an eye to see, so Winston wouldn’t do anything dirty anymore.’

However, the footsteps stopped just before the corner.

Now, what excuse should she use to get out? Sally hurriedly shook her head.

Although she hid her pistol under her skirt, she shouldn’t shoot Winston because her mission for over a year would be in vain. Besides, the moment she was found hiding a gun, she was afraid that even the letter might be taken away.

As she clenched her teeth, the tip of the nose, which had been buried in the nape of her neck, ran up her hair and rubbed over her earlobes. He whispered languidly as he exhaled a hot breath, rubbing between his earlobe and cheek.

“Why are you nervous like that?”

‘Is he asking because he didn’t know?’

Turning her head with tears in her eyes, he suddenly took off his black gloves.

Sally held her breath as his outstretched fingers climbed up the seam at her side. His fingers moved forward, fiddling with the buttons on her bulging chest. Not a single hair touched her chest, but the way he rolled his fingertips was the same as rolling her nipples.

Dirty pervert bastard

“Captain.”

“Yes?”

The hot breath tickled her ear again. Sally sniffled her nose.

“I need the money. I have to pay my mom’s hospital bills soon I can do anything the Captain wants.”

As if Winston had been baptized in cold water, he fell off in an instant.

He was a man with severe mysophobia. It was more when it comes to sex. More than anyone else, Winston hated a woman who jumped at him with her legs spread apart.

Sally erased her smile of relief and covered her weeping face. She turned behind him and found Winston leaning at an angle to the opposite wall, opening his wallet. A look of disappointment was evident on his face.

“Sally, you are a good child. Do not speak such dirty words in front of any men.”

“Did you say that I’m good because I was annoying?”

Sally clasped the wad of bills he was handing out, and his eyes widened. Winston opened his mouth and had a look that he wanted to say something, though only a small sigh came out.

“Thank you, Captain.”

You have to run away when the hungry predator is showing a loophole. Thinking that, she politely said her greetings and tried to run away although, his arm grabbed her.

“Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t mean to offend you. I like you.”

Is this a confession?

Sally froze on the spot.

“I like the boldness of not blinking an eye when seeing blood.”

No It was only then did Winston’s face relax. The corners of his straight lips held a gentle smile.

“If it were any other woman, they would have passed out already. Of course, the boys, too. You’re more trustworthy than these nauseous young recruits.”

The kid recruit he was talking about was obviously Fred.

“I didn’t mean to push you today. Don’t be kind to those rats, they are cunning.”

‘He knew that? He’s a cunning rat, too.’

Sally didn’t hide the smug smile from her lips. After all, the greedy monarch pigs would not know the true meaning of her smile.

“I want you to stay long”

Winston let go of her arm. His fingertips ran across her shoulder, and his well-proportioned knuckles caressed her cheek.

“I wish you could be part of the torture chamber.”

All of the nerves were focused on the tips of her soft, brittle hair.

This meant that he wanted her to remain as the maid in charge of the torture chamber for a long time. That was the way it should be. But, what that cruel man spit out could not have been kind words.

It sounded like to become an organ in a monster that suck human life

Is that not it?

Did that mean he wanted to put her in that torture chamber, put chains around her neck, and pulled out her nails? If no one was being tortured, the torture chamber was just an ordinary room, nothing more, nothing less.

Since Sally didn’t know his reason, it was probably just a simple request to work as the maid for a long time.

Nevertheless, the scary imagination was not easily shaken.

“If you are injured and shed even a drop of blood”

Winston suddenly stopped talking. The hands that were gently stroking her cheek also stopped. His clear eyes, as though he had been stabbed at what he said, went blank. It was as if his eyes, which had always been cold, were quietly blazing hot.

Moments later, his hand, which had stopped, moved again. His fingertips felt unusually hot because of her cold lips.

He pressed down on her soft flesh, scanning from one end to the other. At that moment, he bit his lips with a white tooth. It looked like blood would be oozing out.

Camden’s vampire.

Sally’s face turned pale, recalling the nickname that followed Captain Leon Winston like the hem of his coat. What was this bloodthirsty man imagining about her now that he wanted to bite her lip and suck her blood?

Dangerous This was fatally dangerous.

Sally smiled brightly and clasped her hands together as if praying so that the bills in her hands could be seen very clearly.

‘Look carefully. In my blood, like other women, the filthy snobbish spirit flows.’

“Thank you for your concern. Captain is really generous and kind. I also want to work under Captain for a long, long time.”

The moment she poured out praises that he didn’t even want, Winston’s eyes returned.

Sally was somewhat relieved under the sharp gaze as cold as the blade of a knife. She immediately turned her back and ran away from him. He didn’t hold her back until she got to the corner.

Turning the corner at a rather quick pace and passing the soldiers guarding the door to the torture chamber, Sally sighed in her relief.

But then she bit her lips, just like Winston did.

A rotten world.

It was sadly quite common for a maid to be abused by the filthy hands of the master’s people. Still, she had never heard of such a thing happening on the Winstons. The Winston brothers were notorious for not paying attention to women.

The eldest son, Captain Leon Winston, was a sadistic figure that even the Royal Family that trusted him was fed up, but was famous for his polite and gentle manner only to women. Even he never brought the revolutionary army women into the torture chamber.

The second son, Jerome, was more of a modest scholar than his older brother, who was a soldier. There was no difference in terms of family history or arrogant disposition.

He used to take women into a pedantic discussion when they showed personal curiosity and kicked them out. He hated a woman who was like a porcelain doll with an empty head more than anyone else.

So, would she have imagined it when she infiltrated this mansion as a maid? One of the brothers was rude to her.

A spy must not stand in the eyes or ears of the target. Like all the maids, she tried her best to be treated like the furniture, though the interest was either loved her too much or hated her too much

Where did she go wrong?

To her surprise, she found out the answer in less than ten minutes.


‘Late.’
She couldn’t meet the mail wagon on time because of the goddamn erotomania. Sally ran out the front door of the mansion.

As her breath reached her chin, she saw the front door. Peter, the postman, who had been waiting for her as she chatted with the gatekeeper of the mansion, sneered through her slender grates and laughed.

“You are a little late today, Miss Bristol.”

Even though, at first glance, it looked like a generous smile, she was not unaware that the impatience was a vivid rebuke.

Because time was urgent.

“Yes, ha, Captain, was looking for me.”

’I didn’t come here to play, you bastard.’

When she mentioned ‘Captain,’ Peter’s eyes visibly froze. Sally said she was fine and smiled before holding out the letter from her hand.

“Please, take care of it again today”

“Sally.”

Sally froze at the sudden sound of the voice. Behind her, the soft engine sound of a luxury sedan growled softly.

“Then, I’ll get going.”

Peter snatched the letter from Sally’s hand and ran to the wagon. As he came nearer, the sound of stepping on the little pebbles from behind her grew closer and closer. She turned around casually and smiled.

“Captain, are you on the way out? It’s dinner time soon.”

“I have an engagement.”

He was still wearing an officer’s uniform.

‘Is that a private advance?’

What other heinous things was he going to do?

“I see. Mrs. Winston might be lonely. Then, please enjoy”

“No sweet talks.”

He approached. Again, the distance narrowed to the point of being dangerous.

“Sally, every time I see you, I want to ask you something.”
Chapter 5

“What?”

He regarded his employees as the cogs in the mansion. No one wanted to ask something every time they saw the parts of a machine.

What the hell was he curious about? The maid named Sally Bristol and her family? If that were the case, it would have been enough to recite the details the revolutionary army had already carefully organized.

However, if she recalled his actions from a while ago, it may be very vulgar and private curiosity.

Insults and curses were about to come out of her at once. Sally bit her lips tightly.

“Perhaps”

For some reason, Winston, who had been staring tenaciously into her eyes, spoke softly. The question was neither vulgar nor overly private, though it made Sally hope for a rather vulgar curiosity.

“Did you ever go to Abbington Beach as a child?”

Abbington Beach. The moment she heard the words, her heart sank.

‘Dirty pigs—!’

The mistakes of her childhood were repeated in her mind like a faded movie. Just over a dozen years later that summer was about to take all of her time.

‘No. If you have to ask, it’s just a feeling. There’s no proof.’

It was fortunate that he didn’t ask a trick question. As calmly as possible, that was the only way to live

“Yes?”

Sally tilted her head as if confused.

“No My parents were poor, so we couldn’t afford to go to such a luxury resort”

This time, she lengthened her words sullenly. The corners of her eyes and lips drooped with the weight of the woes of poor Sally Bristol, a poor rural daughter and her only family member was her mother with tuberculosis.

“.”

Winston was silent again.

He stared tenaciously into her eyes, like before he threw a bomb masquerading as a question. Was he looking for evidence of lies or evidence of truth in the turquoise waters of Abbington Beach?

She wanted to close her eyes.

But, even if she did, nothing would change. It wasn’t until Sally’s maid’s blouse started to cling to her skin, wet with sweat, that Winston caught her eye.

“Well, yes.”

He went back to the car with a chuckle and ridicule as he believed that he had made an unreasonable guess.

Soon, the iron gate opened.

With the sound of the ferocious engine, Winston passed Sally. She muttered quietly as she watched the car getting smaller and smaller.

‘Damn my eyes.’


The wheel, which was rolling down the entrance road lined with square bricks, gradually lost speed and stopped.
The iron gate at the end of the road was firmly shut.

Even though the butler had already been informed of the arrival time, the driver, who glanced at Leon’s expression in the rearview mirror, immediately blew the honk loudly. After ringing twice, a middle-aged man hurriedly ran out of the window and opened the door.

The car started moving again, and as they passed by, the gatekeeper hurriedly saluted him, though Leon smiled and turned his gaze to the front.

There was nothing surprising. It was not a matter of a day or two for Grand Duchy Eldrich’s subtle negligence.

‘It’s understandable.’

It was the Winstons who immediately benefited from the deal of engagement. The Grand Duke just looked to the future and invested. So, shouldn’t the scale be tilted to one side?

Leon’s neglect was simply ridiculous.

In order to injure one’s pride, it was necessary to expect, or at least have even the slightest interest in, this transaction.

‘Oh, mother might be outraged.’

The corners of his lips, which had been raised at an angle, soon came down again.

The road that seemed to have no end was finally coming to an end. The magnificent mansion at the end was just one of the many villas of the Grand Duchy.

Even the villa was designed to overwhelm those who set foot in it, worthy of the Grand Duchy’s prestige. But, that also works for those who are in debt with the Grand Duchy. Leon was just annoyed by all of this.

As the car stopped in front of the mansion, the butler of the villa walked slowly. While Leon’s personal attendant, seated in the passenger seat, hastily went out and opened the back seat door, the butler brushed off his shiny hair with pomade.

“Captain Winston, I will guide you to the parlor.”

Even the polite greeting was slow.

Leon closed the folder that had been on his lap and opened the black briefcase on the seat next to him.

His attendant, Pierce, approached to do so, but he raised his hand and refused. He put the file folder and fountain pen in its place and picked up a black cap. Then, he gently put in his hair neatly, pressed the curled hair, and even fixed the shape.

“Captain, if you hurry up a little bit more”

He got out of the car and followed the butler into the villa after the arrogant butler bowed down. He stopped Pierce from following because he was only going to bring the woman out, anyway.

“The Grand Duke is waiting for you.”

However, the news that Grand Duke Eldrich was at Camden’s villa was unexpected. Upon entering the parlor, the Grand Duke, in comfortable clothes, sat up at an angle on the sofa, read the newspaper, and stood up.

“Oh, Captain Winston.”

It was a formal title to call someone who would soon become a family member.

“Your Highness, long time no see.”

“Okay, are you here to pick up Rosalind?”

“Yes.”

“Hmm”

The Grand Duke was fiddling with the long mustache that stretched to the side. His gaze glared down at Leon’s neck.

“It’s nice to see a serious attitude towards dating like fighting a battle.”

The Grand Duke’s words sound like a compliment to the naive, though Leon was far from naive. He couldn’t have not known that the Grand Duke was displeased that he was wearing an officer’s uniform rather than a high-class suit to a date arranged by the adults.

“The work was delayed and this was inevitable.”

He pretended to be modest and smiled, but the Grand Duke couldn’t have not understood that Leon was not interested in this date or even this deal.

“Yes, you must be very busy.”

It was not really work, but his departure was delayed because he had twice glanced at the annoying maid.

“Because even the Captain who keeps his promises like a sword is late today.”

It was an unexpected word. Did the Grand Duke know the time of the appointment with the Lady?

‘Is he really waiting? What business does he have?’

He had a strong feeling that it would be a troublesome story.

“Would you like a drink?”

He didn’t have to answer since it was neither a question nor a suggestion. The Grand Duke walked right into the corner of the parlor and picked up a crystal glass. It was when the liquid was pouring into the glass that someone knocked on the parlor door.

“The Grand Duke, Lady Rosalind has arrived.”

“Oh, come in.”

As the door opened, Leon’s prospective fiancée walked in, ready to go out.

“Captain Winston.”

“Your Highness Lady Aldrich.”

Both of them called each other by names that were too formal for both men and women to be engaged.

As they exchanged greetings, the Lady’s dress couldn’t help but catch his eye. It was far from the fashion these days when skirts were getting shorter every day. The long dress, barely showing her ankles, looked cramped rather than pompous.

She wore only expensive things like the Grand Lady who boasted enormous wealth, though she was a boring woman who made everything seem plain.

Rosalind Aldrich was such a woman.

Even if it was boring, a mission was a mission, even if it was a mission that the elders of the family threw at him to satisfy their greed.

Leon approached the Lady and held out his arm modestly. It was so light that he couldn’t even feel a hand resting on the inside of his arm. She was reluctant to have physical contact with him, so the girl didn’t really like going on a date either.

“Grand Duke, I’ll have a drink next time. The departure time of the cruise ship is near.”

“Yes, please have a meaningful time.”

Only the adults in the family think this deal was meaningful.

There was no conversation between the two people sitting next to each other in a car running along the river across the city.

Pierce, unable to withstand the awkward atmosphere, whispered. He lightly recommends the menus of the cruise ships’ high-end restaurants and bars, adding that he hopes the two will have a good time.

“I don’t like alcohol.”

It was the Lady who spoke first.

This nonsense was probably due to her father recommending drinks to Leon at the villa, or because Pierce recited the bar’s cocktail menu. The Grand Duke was famous for being a drinker. It was common for a woman whose father was a drinker to dislike alcohol.

“I don’t really enjoy it either.”

“Alcohol confuses people’s judgment. They say it makes you forget the pain of life, but it seems to only give you a bigger problem. In particular, it is easy to lose self-control and become indecisive when meeting people.”

Was she trying to say he would make a big mistake when drinking? Leon grew annoyed when the Lady, who would not usually speak her words, gave unsolicited opinions.

He didn’t want to do anything like wasting time in the name of dating. Although since he was in the inferior position in this deal, that woman seemed to know how to attack him and made her pregnant, so as not to smoothen the deal.

‘It’s ridiculous.’

If he really wanted to close this deal, he would have done it sooner. Even if it was not as disgusting as pregnancy, the cards were overflowing, even if he heard it being mean.

In the first place, he was not uninterested in sex to the extent that even seeing a woman’s naked body made him reluctant. It was quite common for high-class prostitutes, who smelled of strong perfumes, to hang out with the officers at drinking parties. Still, no one had ever moved him.

But, why is he in heat with the maid who smelled of blood?

Staring at the Lady’s face, who smelled of powder, Leon repeated the same name in his closed mouth.

‘Sally Bristol Sally, what the hell is she?’

Chapter 6

However, as the speeches of the Grand Lady continued without end, he couldn’t keep thinking of the maid.

“You won’t be able to smell alcohol today. Don’t worry, Grand Lady.”

The woman stared at him.

Did she have more to say? She wiggled her hand nervously as she gripped the tiny crystal and tassel-studded evening bag. Seeing that, Leon tilted his head at an angle and urged her to open her mouth.

“Please, call me Rosalind.”

He lost his words for a moment at the least unexpected request. The woman who was acting like a chihuahua barking to keep from being caught up in fear just a moment ago was suddenly trying to close the distance.

However, they were supposed to live as husband and wife, anyway. A distance they would have to narrow down someday. It would be a big disrespect if the other person did not hold the hand that was reached out first.

“.”

But, even when he opened his lips to call out the name, those three simple syllables did not come out of Leon’s mouth.

Rosalind Aldrich.

Rosalind. Rosalind. The name didn’t stick to his mouth. She was as old-fashioned as her old-fashioned name. In addition, her teaching-like tone and monastic mood made her luxurious evening dress like a nun’s robe.

Come to think of it, there was a person in the Winston family who had the same tone and atmosphere and made a high-class suit into a police suit.

‘Don’t you get along better with Jerome than with me?’

Although it wasn’t Jerome, who might one day receive the title, so, in the marriage talk with the Grand Duchy, his younger brother was not considered from the beginning.

“If you could call me Leon instead of Captain Winston, I would be glad.”

Leon smiled slyly as if he had played a dirty trick on the woman. Of course, he wouldn’t do that kind of trick.

She was a woman with a timid corner, so it was the card that he handed out, knowing that there was no way to call him by name first. Besides, she was so knowledgeable that she would not be pleased with the man’s light trick.

As expected.

The Grand Lady hesitated for a moment before only smiling awkwardly. Her gaze turned to look out the window again, and silence fell inside the car again. Consequently, he managed to get the woman to withdraw her firsthand without being rude.

The car stopped at the marina dyed with the red sunset. The river overflows with gold, and the luxury cruise ships dazzle in the orange lights.

Leon crossed over to the other side of the car and opened the door. On the way to lead the Grand Lady to the cruise ship, he took out the ticket Pierce had given him.

The departure time of the cruise ship was four hours later. It was like a mother’s message to get up earlier than what was written on the ticket.

‘It’s going to be a boring night.’

Following the servant in a black uniform, he got on the elevator to the top floor of the cruise ship. The driver lowered the lever and the elevator, which had been sliding uphill, came to a rough stop as soon as the lever was raised again and shook violently.

“Ah”

Leon’s arm was gripped by a hand that had been resting like a ghost on his arm. The Grand Lady made a slightly bewildered face, and she immediately withdrew the grip from her hand.

The driver behind winked with one eye at Leon and smiled. It was apparently a surprise show for the men and women who were dating.

‘What a useless thing to do’

It looked like the driver wanted a tip, though he just looked away coldly.

The lattice door of the elevator opened, and the servant walked along the soft carpeted hallway. The moment the massive door at the end of the hallway opened on both sides, the sound of music blew out, leaving Leon smiling lightly at it.

A man in a tuxedo slid his fingers over the keys on a grand piano in the corner of the restaurant hall. It was classical music, not jazz, which his mother said was disgusting.

A chair lined with dark mahogany and floral fabric. Columns and frescoes adorned with patches and feathers The classic interior was completely to his mother’s taste.

At a time when corsets were becoming obsolete, she was still a conservative person who insisted on wearing corsets made of whalebone. Thinking back, even the prospective fiancée followed his mother’s taste.

Eventually, the two sat down at the table by the window and accepted the menu brought by the waiter. The wine menu was returned immediately, and the dishes were picked.

“What would you like?”

“I will take what you recommend.”

Did she grow up with an old-fashioned education to not reveal her intentions and be quiet?

The Grand Lady wasn’t very helpful in choosing the dinner menu. It was completely different from when she said she didn’t like alcohol a while ago. She was a mysterious woman, though he was not even interested in finding out more about her.

Leon ordered the most expensive thing and started chatting nonsense—today’s weather, the scenery outside the window, the Grand Duke’s health The conversation often got cut off and scrambled.

He was already bored.

“What are you doing these days?”

The Grand Lady’s question was unexpected. She must already know his nickname and asked what he was doing.

‘Do that girl really want to hear it?’

How much trouble the Western Command suffered because of a rat of the Blanchard rebels that was caught three years after infiltrating as the knight of the Western Command He spent days and nights trying to figure out what information had been leaked.

And, how the cunning man trembled with fear.

How funny it was to be foaming at the mouth when he plucked the little fingernail of his right hand.

‘If I tell her, that woman will turn blue.’

Oh, one more thing. How ridiculous it was that the commander’s scruffy face had become thin like a mummy these days.

If he told her, would she laugh or would she be offended?

It turned out that one of the commander’s numerous mistresses was also a rebel spy, so he was in danger of being summoned to the royal court.

What about the mistress?

The spy was a woman. Besides, they are prostitutes in the name of the Revolutionary Army. Leon felt dirty, so he handed it over to the superiors to take care of.

Mean people who used women for dangerous and dirty work Though could he do it without being a mean person? Because he didn’t think the superiors know how to deal with women, it was enough as long as he didn’t get his hands dirty.

A Lady who wrote poetry and embroidered in the corner of the room didn’t need to know about such dirty things.

“It would be a boring story.”

At his euphemistic refusal, the Grand Lady misunderstood and blushed her face.

“Ah, this It’s like I’m asking for a military secret.”

“It’s no secret that the Western Commander resembles a frog.”

At the silly joke, the Grand Princess laughed innocently.

He was utterly bored, hoping that the work of adding one more ‘Mrs. Winston’ to the family would be completed soon.

It was like something one would say when buying a watchdog. After marriage, his duties as the eldest son of the family would be completed. It meant that he didn’t have to waste time on such frivolous ‘dates.’

‘Looking at the slowness, there must be a formidable battle going on.’

Leon didn’t know how far the engagement discussions had progressed. This was because the terms of the engagement were being discussed only by the elders of the family, away from the parties involved. Besides, he wasn’t really interested, so he never asked.

“Leon, you do your job. This is my job.”

Even though he had no intention of getting involved, his mother used to say, with a serious face, like how the main character would say while rolling up their sleeves. It was the attitude regarding his marriage as her own masterpiece.

That was understandable.

Elizabeth Winston. Before she became Mrs. Winston, she was called the Count’s Lady.

She married his father, who she firmly believed would soon receive the title, though when her son grew up, she was still only ‘Mrs. Winston.’ Since she was born as a Count’s Lady, she was told that she would die as a Countess, like how a terminal tuberculosis patient vomits blood.

‘I’m out of luck.’

All of Winston’s predecessors Madam had died as Countesses.

From generation to generation, the Winston family was Count Winston. However, as the royal family fled abroad after being chased by a rebellion under the guise of a ‘revolution,’ the payment was cut off.

His grandfather, who was a count at the time, abandoned the royal family at once and took the hand of the rebels. His father often sneered, recalling that his grandfather pretended to be the prophet that said a new world had arrived.

The new world he spoke of was a world in which capital, not status, became power. His grandfather raked in his fortune from a business he had run as a dog of the first ‘revolutionary government.’

At the time, his father, who was a vigorous cadet, despised his grandfather and followed the royal family abroad. He said it was like hearing the voice of a blind person who couldn’t see the future and was blocked in front and behind.

However, the blind person who could not see the future was his grandfather.

The ‘revolutionary government’ had disintegrated within a decade. Their ideals were very lax, and individual understanding easily seeps into the gap.

Evidence of this was that even rats who still support the rebel ideology throw away their ideology after spending three or four days in the torture chamber. Ideology was not going to help them when they got whipped and had their nails pulled out.

The royal family and the royalists could not miss the chaos. The monarchy was restored in an instant, and the ‘Republic of Lippon’ became the ‘Kingdom of Lippon’ again.

As soon as the royal family returned, it was only natural that they set out to punish the traitors.

Fortunately, his father made a significant contribution to the restoration of the monarchy. The Winston family was only deprived of their Count title. They were able to defend his position and property as a wealthy landowner in the Camden area.

The royal family made a promise to his father, who was then young. They said they would return the title if he did a good job in eradicating the remnants of the rebels. It was said that his father, who was originally a royal dog, had since become a more loyal royal dog.

And, around this time, a Count with a title but no money made his daughter Mrs. Winston, saying it was a prospective investment.

‘Everyone is so stupid.’

Because that promise has yet to be kept.

Chapter 7

His father was attacked by a rebel spy and met a disgraceful end at a young age.

Because of that, the duty to reclaim his title thereafter naturally fell to the eldest son, Leon. He entered the military academy earlier than others. After his appointment, he traveled through numerous battlefields and rebel hideouts, earning the title of war hero and vampire at the same time.

Now, it was his next duty to marry the daughter of the family who would help him regain his title.

He was raised with military-style education from birth. They didn’t ask if he didn’t want to do it, anyway, and it was no longer unusual now that he did it silently.

He was called Camden’s vampire because of the notoriety that the places he passed were going to be bloody, though in fact, the nickname Camden’s loyal military dog ??might be more appropriate.

‘Can I call that woman the Grand Duchy’s gentle sheep?’

Leon stared at the Grand Lady, who was looking out the window on the deck.

Compared to the Grand Lady, the eldest son of the Winston family was of a lower rank. Nevertheless, the reason why the Grand Duke took this marriage seriously was because the civil war was not over yet.

It was a world where soldiers were on the road to success.

Among the many young officers, Leon was the most promising. The Grand Duke was just starting to rise, and he was using one of his daughters to buy this high-risk but high-return stock at a bargain price.

So, Rosalind Aldrich was the Grand Duke’s scapegoat.

He spoke to the woman with a dull face again.

“Do you like this place?”

“Yes.”

According to his intuition, who had been interrogating spies for many years, that was a lie.

“I’m glad. It was a mistake to leave the restaurant reservations with mother. I was a little bit regretful.”

At his words, a smirk spread across the Grand Lady’s face.

“Mrs. Winston has a good eye.”

“Thank you. I will pass it to my mother.”

After a meaningless smile, the Grand Lady smiled slowly along with him.

The waiter brought the meal as soon as the woman opened her mouth firmly as if she had something to say. After that, every now and then, talking about cooking a word or two, was all they had in the conversation.

Emptying the plate quickly didn’t make it any faster to escape from here. Nevertheless, his body wanted to get out of this place quickly, so he finished the meal in an instant.

The Grand Princess also put down the fork and knife, even though the plate wasn’t even half empty.

“Sorry. If you’re in the military, you’ll get used to the speed of men’s meals.”

Apologizing for the menu, he moved to the cafe on the same floor later. Since he couldn’t starve his guest, he was thinking of offering a cake.

“No. In fact, it was too much for me to eat.”

The Grand Lady, like a lady, declined the dessert and ordered tea. While she was waiting for the tea, her eyes kept getting closer to his face as he stared out the window.

Leon, who became embarrassed, finally could not bear it and asked.

“Do you have anything to say?”

The Grand Lady looked like she had been caught. She did the obvious, and it wasn’t even funny. Then, what was so funny, as he said to himself, he smiled softly and opened her mouth.

“You’re not as scary as the rumors are.”

Leon suppressed a ridicule.

‘Stupid woman. Did you know that I could wield a whip at you?’

No matter how vicious the rumors were, they wouldn’t be wrong. It was just that he couldn’t show his true face to the Grand Princess.

“The Captain is really generous and kind.”

What kind of woman saw all of his true qualities and called him generous and kind?

Sally Bristol.

He didn’t think she was stupid. Rather, she looked like a fox pretending to be stupid.

The gap between her mouth, which uttered she admired him, and her eyes, which said she despised him, were worth seeing. He wanted to take off her mask and drive her to a dead end until she fully revealed her true feelings.

Then, would he know if the fox was a wicked female or a cunning trickster?

‘For example’

Leon took a deep breath as the cruel impulse suddenly simmered.

Rolling Sally’s black maid’s suit skirt and spread her slender calves. Shoving his pistol into the cramped, damp spot that would reveal itself if he ripped open the middle of the pure white bloomer.

As the cold muzzle stirs the soft flesh, she would out a moan closer to pain than pleasure. Pulling the pistol from her twitching flesh, the woman’s lewd water would run down through the moist muzzle and wet his hands.

‘I can’t stand it.’

Leon crossed his legs, which had already been crossed to one side, more tightly. Why did the front of his trousers become so tight just by imagining that poor woman?

Was it because of her eyes?

“It was a good time.”

It was already close to midnight when he dropped off the Grand Lady at the villa.

“I had a good time, too.”

Leon’s bright smile made the Grand Lady widen her eyes in surprise. She thought he would tell lies like her, although he expressed it as if he really enjoyed it.

It looked unbelievable.

Indeed, it was a pretty good time. The last two hours on the cruise ship were so much fun that his pants were tight and uncomfortable.

“Well, see you next time.”

As he was about to let the Grand Lady into the villa and get into the car, the butler quickly walked out of the entrance.

“Captain Winston, the Grand Duke asks if you are not busy, how about paying off the debt you owe today?”

It was for having refused to drink alcohol in the evening.

“Oh, dear”

Leon pretended to be flustered and rubbed his forehead with his index finger, which was wearing black gloves, before answering.

“I already promised the Grand Lady that she won’t be able to smell alcohol today If you tell him that I don’t want to be a man who already lost his wife’s trust, then His Grace would be very understanding. Tell him that I will pay back the debt with interest.”

Then, he got into the car, leaving the Grand Duchy and the butler staring at him strangely. Overtime work without results was prohibited.

In fact, there was a pile of things that had to be done urgently in the front of his pants.


In short, it was a very difficult day.
Sally sighed as she lay on her bed and thought back on the day.

Creak.

The creaks of the old bed echoed in the empty room. The maid’s room in the attic of the annex was spacious enough to accommodate four people. After Ethel left, she was the only one left in the annex, so she was enjoying the luxury of being alone.

“Oh, what kind of wind is really blowing today?”

So, even the complaints in her head can come out of her mouth.

There had never been a day she had been more weary with Winston than she was today. Although he was a very fickle human being, she thought she was going to become a ghost due to a heart attack because he flashed here and there like a ghost today.

Did that wild beast-like intuition get triggered?

“Have you ever been to Abbington Beach as a child?”

Her long sigh crossed the still room.

Those damn eyes.

Spies should be plain-looking.

Because when people tried to make a montage in their head, it had to be so uncharacteristic that it would be difficult to describe in detail. In fact, she thought she just had a typical look. It was because her usual dark brown hair was a simple impression that was difficult to catch at a glance

Except for these turquoise eyes.

Even if she honed her other skills as a spy, her natural appearance could not be helped. In addition, disguises were also limited.

A day like this might come because of her unique eyes, she warned before being placed in this mansion. However, she didn’t listen.

“The leaders must set an example.”

James ‘Little Jimmy’ Blanchard Jr. The young leader of the Blanchard Revolutionary Army and her fiancé.

Sally never complained, no matter how hard he entrusted his fiancée with any grueling operations.

She never wished for a life that was sitting quietly in the house, raising children, rummaging through a catalog of kitchenware, and preparing a course meal just in time for her husband to arrive. Rather than being loved as a woman by her fiancé, she wanted to be recognized as an equal comrade like her father to her mother.

So, it wasn’t because she was a coward that she rejected the Winston infiltration operation. It was because she feared that the operation would be ruined by her physical features that Captain Winston might remember.

‘Look at this now. I’m right, wasn’t I?’

It might be better to put someone else in here and then withdraw quickly. After all, one small crack could lead to collapse. Today’s negligence did not mean that Winston had completely cut off the buds of suspicion.

‘I’m going to have to call Jimmy’

Regardless, the torture room was empty, so there wouldn’t be much work tomorrow.

‘Shall we go to the post office tomorrow? I’ll also use the phone’

Sally stared across the room into the chest of drawers. Inside a rolled-up sock contained a large sum of money unintentionally extorted from Winston today.

‘Shall I send them some money?’

She was sending it to headquarters along with last week’s weekly pay as military funds. Unlike the weekly wage, it was money that no one knew about, so she could spend it in a gulp. Still, her conscience did not allow it. Besides, she had nowhere else to use it, anyway.

Well A cup of cafe au lait and a piece of cake at Madame Benoa’s cafe would be fine?

“You know what’s better than a piece of cake?”

She knew. It would be one thing.

Chapter 8
She suddenly remembered her older brother, although they had different looks and personalities, though with the same taste that liked sweets.

Was this voice right? The more she tried to remember, the fainter it got.

It had been a while since she met her brother because he abandoned his family. The moment his older brother, who was more proud than anyone that his grandfather was a pivotal player in the revolution, fell in love, he changed.

“I will live for my family.”

“Family? The Revolutionary Army is our family.”

But, he resisted Sally’s suggestion.

“My children will not be raised like my father. My wife, like my father Ha, damn it”

“Are you crazy? There was no one better than our father.”

The revolutionary army was like a family, and the cause of making the world a better place for all. Eventually, her older brother gave up on all this and succumbed to the ugly reality.

Sally must have been the only one who felt heartbroken when she was pointed out by her comrades, who were once family, for being a coward. She called him once a year to restore his heart on every anniversary of their mother, who died honorably during the operation.

However, her brother said he had no regrets.

[ Rather, I am really happy now. Mother will be proud of you. ]

Were those words sincere? How could he be sincere?

Moreover, her mother, who had devoted her life to the revolution, could not be proud of her son, who had run away cowardly.

[ You, too, come out of there. Let’s live together. Martha is looking forward to living with you. ]

No, that was not going to happen. Like her mother, even if she had to sacrifice her life, she would not run away. She would be the child her mother would be truly proud of.

Creak.

The bed creaked again.

Sally, who had been tossing and turning without being able to sleep, suddenly froze. It was because a man’s footsteps echoed outside the door.

‘Who?’

At this time, the purpose of the man who comes to the room where the maid was alone couldn’t be pure. To make her run an errand, it was enough to ring the bell by pulling the cords all over the annex.

Sally put her hand under her mattress and picked up the little revolver pistol. As she double-checked that it was loaded, the blunt footsteps stopped in front of the door.

Pushing the magazine back in, an intruder from the night knocked on the door.

“Who is it?”

She pretended to just be awake and paused for a moment before asking. She felt a little relieved once he knocked on the door. If he had turned the doorknob, it would undeniably impure intentions.

“it’s me.”

It’s me.

She was stunned, and a sigh broke out. She already knew who he was just by the voice. She had no chance to think about the arrogance of assuming that she would know who he was even if he didn’t say his name.

Sally turned her gaze to the clock on the side table. It was already past midnight, though what had brought him up here?

“Ah, Captain Please, wait.”

Although her mouth was a steady maid, her act of sticking her revolver into the back of the pajama pants was of a seasoned soldier.

She strode towards the door. Before she opened the door, Sally pulled a small wooden wedge placed in the corner with her feet and placed it in front of the door. Then, she cleared her expression for a moment and unlocked the locks.

“Captain, do you need anything?”

The moment she opened the door half a span, she carefully pushed the wedge with her foot and slid it under the door. It would not be seen in Winston’s eyes.

As long as she stepped on the wedge she had set, he could not easily open the door, no matter how muscular the man was.

Sally held the doorknob in one hand and the revolver behind her back in the other. The narrow doorway barely let in the light from the hallway, making it difficult to see Winston’s face. This was because his huge figure had filled that long gap.

“Captain?”

He took a deep breath, and she paused for a moment before opening his mouth.

“Hello, Sally.”

“Oh, yes. Hello. Are you back now?”

Pretending to wake up from her sleep, she deliberately opened her eyes in a drowsy way and lowered her voice.

“Yes.”

“You’re late. You must have been very busy.”

“It was rather boring.”

“Ah Then Lieutenant Campbell and”

“Sally.”

“Yes?”

She was going to ask him to go there as she saw the other soldiers playing billiards at night, but Winston cut off her words.

In addition, his voice as he greeted her, “Hello, Sally,” was heavier than when he politely said hello. Sally gave strength to her foot as she stepped on the wedge and stretched her index finger next to the trigger of the revolver.

“I did my job, so you have to do yours, too.”

An unusual sense of intimidation emanating from his instructions, which she did not know the intention of, crossed the narrow gap in the door and weighed her down. She slowly pulled out the revolver’s muzzle that had been lodged under her waist.

“What are you talking about”

“I mean, you have to do the cleaning.”

Her mind went blank.

“Yes?”

“The office.”

Sally swallowed a lethargic sigh again. The revolver’s muzzle rested quietly on her waist.

‘What? Office cleaning?’

She originally thought he was insane. However, had he really turned crazy? At that, she stared blankly at the figure, who she still couldn’t see the expression, and took a deep breath.

‘Is he drunk, you insane man?’

Nonetheless, there was no smell of alcohol at all.

In the middle of the night, too, well past midnight, the story of waking up a maid to finish cleaning the office. Sally didn’t know if the office was a mess like a pigsty, though it was the place she most painstaking cleaned after the torture room.

They had to break the status system because of people like him.

“Ah Yes”

Just as she answered, revealing her trembling heart, Winston pushed the door inward. The doorknob wobbled. Not only that, he muttered in a slightly bewildered voice when it didn’t even budge.

“Good power.”

“Haha Yes, I am originally thank you.”

“Come on out.”

“I’ll just change my clothes and go down immediately, Captain.”

Even though she was about to close the door, this time, it didn’t even move because of Winston. He stood silently outside, clutching the doorknob.

Though she couldn’t see what he was doing, Sally felt it.

The skin that was hidden under the thin pajamas stung. He was now scanning her body with his eyes.

Dirty horny.

She had already said she would go down, so she had no excuse to suddenly say she couldn’t go.

Should she force Lieutenant Campbell to sit down? She decided to bring a sleeping pill, just in case. If she saw any strange signs, she would put the sleeping pills in the carbonated water he would normally drink.

“Captain?”

“Yes. I’ll go down first.”

As soon as Winston released the doorknob, she closed and locked the door. It took quite a while before she could hear footsteps moving away from the door.

‘Damn it! I’ll be sure to call Jimmy tomorrow.’

The hard day isn’t over yet.

“Ah”

As soon as she entered the office with her cleaning tools, she let out a mournful sigh.

The office was a mess comparable to that of a pigsty. Between the desk and the coffee table, the red carpet was strewn with large black stains. Should he see it as kindness for not asking what the mark was? There was still an ink bottle lying on the side.

Crazy bastard

The crazy bastard was sitting proudly behind his desk, smoking a cigar.

She didn’t know if he had a plan, or if he was just venting his anger at the maid who has been ignoring that things weren’t going well.

“Are you here? It took a long time to come in wearing only clothes.”

If the other person were a normal person, she would have been relieved to see that bright smile on his face. However, the other person was a human who smiled as he saw a prisoner being chased by a bloodthirsty military dog.

Sally had a bad feeling about it.

Before she came here, she looked around the library. However, there was no one there as if everyone had gone to sleep. She thought about waking up Fred, who was sleeping on the first floor, but she stopped because she feared that the soldiers in the same room would find it suspicious.

Then, she would have to put him to sleep with sleeping pills

Set down a bucket of cleaning tools next to the stain, Sally put on an expression that she had made a mistake as she deliberately walked over to the desk.

“Oh sorry. I’ll bring you something to drink right now.”

There should be a bottle and glass of sparkling water Winston always drinks on the desk. She took the tray on her way out during the day and never brought it back.

“No, I don’t need it.”

As soon as she turned around, his words blocked her escape.

“Come here.”

As she turned around and glanced at Winston, their gaze intertwined through the ghostly smoke, and he lifted his straight index finger at Sally.

Her steps toward the desk, carrying the bucket again, were cautious. It felt like she was walking on thin ice rather than a soft carpet. The hot gaze that never left her seemed to melt the thin ice. If she fell into the black pit as it is, what kind of hell will open its mouth wide inside?

Standing at the desk, Winston shook his head lightly.

“Yes?”

“This way.”

Uttering so, the tip of his index finger pointed to his side.

Sally’s legs were as good as tortoises as she walked around the desk as instructed, though her heart raced like a hare.


Chapter 9

‘If Winston attacks me, is there any way to get out?’

There were many ways to get out. It was rare to find a way to escape undetected as a specially trained spy.

While she stood politely with her hands next to Winston, he turned to Sally. With his outstretched legs slid over the other knee, the sharp black nose lifted up and caught on the hem of Sally’s skirt. As soon as she took a step back, he held out his empty hand to her.

Though his feet lifted the ends of her skirt like a mischievous boy, and his hand was like a gentleman.

“Yes?”

Not knowing what to ask, she tilted her head. At that, Winston pointed to the ceiling with a hand holding a cigar. When she followed his hand, a black chandelier caught her eye.

As Sally glanced down again, he held out his hand again, pointing his eyes at the chandelier.

“If you wait on the sofa for a while”

“Just do it.”

“The dust will fall.”

“It’s your job to clean it up.”

What kind of trick was this?

Deeply buried in the leather backrest, he showed his strong will to keep getting hit by the dust falling from the chandelier.

‘Yes. If I could hit your head with a duster, I’d gladly clean it up.’

With no choice, Sally eventually put down her bucket and picked up the duster in it.

She stopped as she tried to hold his hand, which was held out in front of her as stubborn as someone who had come to collect a debt. It would also be her job to erase her footprints when she went up to the desk with her shoes.

Standing on the desk and lifting one foot behind, she tugged at her thin shoelaces. As Sally pulled them apart, she grabbed the heels of her shoes with her hands and pulled them gently down.

From the moment her white stocking-covered feet were pulled out of the black shoes, Winston kept his eyes on her as if taking them off was an interesting spectacle.

His eyes ripped her open even at these everyday things like a newspaper.

The only way to get out of the uncomfortable gaze quickly was to do what was ordered quickly and leave. With that thought, Sally took his hand without hesitation and placed her knee on her desk.

“Ahh”

It was just then Winston’s hand fell off, and she was about to stand up with one foot on the desk. Sally grabbed his left foot, which had been sticking out of the edge of the desk. As the wind shook her body, she hurriedly put her hands on the desk.

She looked over her shoulder, lying face down like a sprinter right before starting. Perhaps, he will pull up her skirt. She hurriedly reached back with one hand and pressed the hem of her skirt, but stumbled.

His gaze was on something else entirely.

“Captain?”

Winston grinned, not taking his eyes off Sally’s toes. His thick thumb touched the soft flesh with the thin stockings in between and gently swept the gentle curves. From her toes to the back, goosebumps rose.

The sound of pain seemed to come out at the intentionally tickling touch. If she did, it was clear that it would be a promiscuous misunderstanding.

Sally bit her lips firmly.

His soft touch changed when she pulled her foot in as a sign to let go. Winston asked as he clasped his long fingers together and wrapped them around her feet.

“What do you do with the money I gave you?”

Sally’s resistance stopped at the unexpected topic. What was his reason for suddenly bringing up the money story?

“My mother’s hospital bills”

“Did you send it?”

“No, not yet.”

She could give it back if he asked for it, that was no problem.

A large landowner was said to be a bit shy, though the more he had, the more greedy he was. But, what if not? A sensible author would have noticed loopholes if they bit into Sally Bristol’s personal details.

Sally opened her mouth again, wetting her dry lips.

“Why?”

“Set some money aside to buy a pair of stockings.”

“Ack—!”

What was he talking about? Sally didn’t even have time to ask, because moments later, a screeching sound came out of her mouth in horror. It was because of the thick thumb digging into her stockings and rubbing her thick flesh.

“There is a hole.”

Winston’s voice was mixed with a light laugh. It was fortunate that it was only a mischievous playfulness, not a sharp sense. Still, she couldn’t relax.

As he put his thumb in the hole in the bottom of the stocking and swung it around, his fingers went deep into the hole and teased her little toe.

Riip.

As the hole ripped even more, Sally’s cheeks turned bright red.

“What kind of hospital, huh? Do I pay less per week? It’s probably not like that, but you don’t have the money to buy a pair of stockings, so you’re wearing things with holes in them? Sally, how do I feel when you see this?”

“Ah, that’s not it Captain, I’ll definitely buy a new one tomorrow, so please let me go. Well, the cleaning”

Leon smiled and raised his hand.

Even though she was on his desk, the maid got up hastily and ran to the corner. A woman whose face did not change even when she saw blood was turning red because of this.

“How fun.”

Maniac.

Sally quickly wiped the chandelier, pouring into herself all the vulgarity she knew.

Son of a bitch. Eat the dust

She brushed the ostrich fur on the tip of the duster against the top of Winston’s golden crown. However, no matter how many times she rubbed, the dust did not come off. After all, it had only been a few days since she cleaned the chandelier.

In the end, she had no choice but to finish quickly and go down. Her timid retaliation was abandoned, and she turned her back as she rubbed the front of the chandelier.

“That’s right.”

A muffled murmur passed over her calves wrapped in thin stockings.

“Yes?”

As she turned around, Sally could hear a creaking sound.

Looking down, Winston pretended not to have done anything and was leaning far away from the back of his chair. The cigar in his hand seemed to have been burned, not smoked, so a lump of grayish ash was hanging from the end of the short cigar.

“No, I’m talking to myself.”

“Ah. Yes”

The maid smiled politely. However, the moment she turned her head, her turquoise eyes cried out.

‘I hate you.’

Leon smiled obliquely as he brushed his cigar into the ashtray.

White.

This evening, sitting face to face with the Grand Princess, his imagination was correct.

Sally’s bloomers were white.

Now that he had checked the color of her underwear, it was natural that he wanted to check the color inside. Was it the same color as his imagination?

He wanted to put his hand inside that black skirt and white underskirt and rip open the dense seam in the middle of the bloomer at once. Leon bit his smooth lower lip with the tip of his tongue and abruptly chewed it with his sharp teeth.

He wondered if a man had ever seen it?

He rubbed the tip of the cigar into the ashtray and put it out, as if hitting it in the eyes of a man whom he didn’t even know existed.

“It’s done, Captain. Then, I will clean the carpet.”

Pretending to clean the chandelier was almost over. Sally crept down under the desk before Winston scolded her.

Dirty horny.

It was disgusting to hold her hand as if he was a gentleman when he was just spying under her skirt.

It was fortunate that Winston didn’t bother her anymore. Sally knelt down on the carpet and started wiping away the black stains. She was engrossed in the thought of cleaning it up and leaving. When she came to her senses, quite a bit of time had passed.

Meanwhile, Winston was as though he had evaporated.

There was no sound of him flipping through papers, nor of lighting a lighter. She confirmed with occasional deep breaths that the other person, unfortunately, had not evaporated.

Since the ink did not dry out because he had just spilled it, it was not difficult to erase it. The spot where it was stained was a little darker than the other places, but she’ll just let it go.

Sally raised her body, unwrapped her crumpled skirt, and turned behind to face Winston. He was gazing at her with his hand lightly clenched against his slanted chin. Was he no longer smoking cigars? His right hand was under the desk and was not visible.

What was so interesting to see an ordinary maid routinely wiping carpet stains? The corners of his lips curled up slightly.

Where did his usual sharpness go? A strangely soft, sticky gaze fell from Sally’s face into her hands, which were carefully clasped together.

Did he take a drink? Though there was no water, let alone alcohol, on the desk.

“It’s all done. Do you need anything more?”

Winston nodded his head lightly.

So, was there something to be done or not?

Sally tilted her head slightly, and her gaze turned to the ashtray under his chin. An ashtray made of black marble lay in the ashes of a high-quality cigar that Winston had wasted a while ago.

‘I can go out with the excuse of emptying the ashtray.’

Thinking that, she walked over to Winston with a light foot and picked up the ashtray.

However, she hardened like stone.

It was because his hand, covered in thick tendons and veins, had slid slowly under the desk. The copper-colored object he held in his hand also had tendons and veins that stood out smoothly.

“Gasp!”

Bang.

The ashtray slid from Sally’s hand and fell to the edge of the desk.

Chapter 10
The black marble shattered, and shards splattered.

As soon as she closed her eyes reflexively and opened it, Sally regretted it. She shouldn’t have opened her eyes.

It was because Winston still had the copper-colored object in his hand.

At first, she thought he was holding a cigar. He was casually holding it in both hands, so it was really similar to ordinary things like a cigar, and the color and shape were similar.

However, could a cigar be as thick as Sally’s wrist?

He put the maid in the same room to do the cleaning, and it was creepy to know that he was masturbating in secret. But, what was even more creepy was the fact that he was holding his penis in his hands even after being caught.

‘This horny manic is really’

So far, calling Winston a maniac was half the truth and half as an insult. Though now, this moment had become an impeccably complete fact.

A maniac who needed to be put in a mental hospital right now.

Sally was holding back her tears.

For the cause of overthrowing the corrupt monarchy and making a more equal and fair world for all, she had taken on all kinds of dirty and filthy missions. Still, was looking at the enemy’s dirty and thick penis a sacrifice for that cause, too?

She even sensed a feeling of doubt she had never felt before.

If one day the monarchy was overthrown, she would chop it up with a guillotine.

“What’s the matter? It’s your first time seeing it?”

His questioning voice was clear. It was then that Sally realized that she had been unable to take her eyes off that awful ‘cigar’ and was startled. Raising her gaze to Winston’s face, he smiled with gentle curls of his eyes.

What was the difference between a neat smile and an unneat object?

That filthy bastard didn’t even look surprised. On the contrary, she felt like she had become a strange person instead. Between his smiling eyes, his pale blue eyes stared straight at her. Sally realized at that moment, that he was observing her reaction.

He was not caught masturbating. He was deliberately showing it to see how she behaved.

She didn’t know what the hell he was doing. It didn’t take a day or two for the royalists to try to identify the spies. Nonetheless, none of the tricks she had ever seen and heard of was pulling out their penis and showing it.

“I’m sorry, Captain!”

First of all, running away from the office was a priority. She turned her back from the carpet that had been messed up by the ashtray she had dropped and pretended not to know.

“If I give you money, you said you will do anything?”

Behind her back, the chair creaked.

Winston got up. As the sound of stepping on the soft carpet drew closer, her heart pounded with every blunt sound of his hard heels.

“I can do anything the captain wants.”

It was meant to tie up Winston, who was attacking her in heat. Instead, now, the noose was holding her.

“I don’t know what that ‘anything’ is.”

Although he whispered in a low voice like sharing a secret between the two of them, Sally listened carefully.

His lips were close enough to gently caress her earlobe. It wasn’t just the lips that were close. His chest pressed against her shoulders. Something was pressing on her back as well, but Sally didn’t want to know what it was.

“Can you show me?”

“What are you talking about?”

She asked, swallowing a gulp.

“You know what to do.”

Before she could say something, his long fingers wrapped around her forearm. He suddenly turned her body, and she had to face Winston. The tip of her nose was close enough to hit his chest. Sally lowered her head to cover her nose and then tightly closed her eyes.

Crazy guy. Crazy guy. Crazy guy.

‘Is he still holding that one out?’

“You don’t know?”

Sally shook her head swiftly and shut her eyes till her brow furrowed.

The corners of Leon’s lips, which were raised formed perfect symmetry. He grabbed the maid’s chin lightly and pressed her cheeks with his thumb and middle finger. At that, the soft flesh slipped in and her pink lips fluttered open.

Sally finally opened her eyes, and she made eye contact with him.

The eyes were the windows of truth. And, Leon tenaciously digs into the truth and lies through the mysterious turquoise eyes.

“I can do anything you want”

As Sally tried to close her mouth, he tightened his fingers on her cheeks even more. A thin moan escaped from her mouth, moist with saliva, making it even more difficult to take his eyes off the red hole.

Wouldn’t it be nice to get bitten by that sharp tooth and bleed?

Putting his index finger in her mouth, he pressed against her soft tongue. The woman flinched and tried her best to get away from him.

Brave woman.

At this point, she would cry for fear. However, her dry eyes were tearing off his fingers and chewing them up.

“I mean, have you ever put anything like this in your mouth with those dirty words?”

He swept up the object he was holding in his other hand.

As Leon took one step closer, the woman was startled and took a step back. If she touched it, it would spread illness and she would die.

“Your answer?”

The woman grabbed his wrist and whimpered like a puppy, then shook her head briefly. It was strangely unpleasant to gasp with her mouth open forcibly every time his penis caught her eye.

‘It doesn’t look like she’d ever done it.’

If she had ever sold herself for money, she wouldn’t close her eyes in horror when he asked her to show him what she could do.

Though he used some snarky method, he achieved it.

Leon smiled contentedly and took the strength from his hand. Because of that, Sally stumbled for a moment as he accidentally released her.

‘What the hell is he up to?’

Winston, on some whim, suddenly adjusted his clothes.

Her mind was so messed up that she forgot for a moment that she had to run when she saw a gap. She glared at Winston, wiping the saliva from her lips with her sleeve.

She had occasionally seen vulgar photos hidden under the mattresses of her male comrades. How disgusting it was to see the naked women in the photos with the men’s genitals in their mouths. She didn’t know how many were burned with a lighter.

Even though she had never seen anything like that under Winston’s bed in the annex, the other person was also a man. There was no way he’d be unaware of such a disgusting thing.

Consequently, she figured he would just grab her shoulder and press her down. So, when he pressed her shoulder, she would immediately try to kick between his legs.

A soldier who left his vital points in front of the enemy. How pathetic.

But, as soon as she said she had never done such a disgusting thing, he let her go, just like a person who did this absurd thing just to hear the answer.

In the end, she was caught by him.

Whether this maid has ever had a man or sold her body has nothing to do with him.

Winston turned around while he bucked his belt again. This time, the frightened maid tried to run away without even saying her greetings, though she was caught again.

“There.”

Sally secretly clenched her fist. She wanted to pound that sharp nose with her fists to make it a puffy, bulbous nose. Still, she couldn’t do it, so she released the power from her hand.

This time, instead of turning her around, Winston walked in front of her. In his hand was the handkerchief that had wiped Sally’s tears from the torture chamber at lunchtime.

Was he telling her to wash it?

She politely held out both hands to get it and leave, but the handkerchief was next to Sally’s lips, not her hand.

“Sally, you’re bleeding.”

The moment she broke the ashtray, she had a tingling in her cheek. Although all of her senses were paralyzed by what was happening before his eyes, she completely forgot that she was injured.

He wiped the wound with an uncharacteristically friendly hand. The sweeter Winston was, the more anxious she became.

His true form was far from sweet.

‘Hey, please come back to your original arrogant one. As you always do, shouldn’t I be treated as a consumable item for the mansion?’

He didn’t even know that Sally was staring at him. His gaze was fixed on the red stain on the silk handkerchief.

“I’ll wash it”

Sally raised her gaze as she held out her hand toward the handkerchief. The moment their eyes met, her intuition exclaimed.

Dangerous.

As Winston grabbed her chin, she stepped backward. His lips came straight up. Before their lips overlapped, she tried to turn her head in bewilderment.

Winston turned Sally’s head first. His lips touched her cheek. It was the wounded spot. Immediately, a stinging pain erupted as a soft mass of flesh soaked in warmth and moisture licked her skin. Hot breaths poured down her cheeks.

Sally froze as if she had been hit by a bitter winter storm.

He lifted his lips, but she was still frozen blank. The nickname vampire was by no means a metaphor. Winston’s breath grew heavy as he tasted her blood. It was quite different from the sound of his even breathing when he stroked his genitals in front of her a while ago.

His sharp eyes were also disturbed. He squeezed his eyes shut and bit his lower lip. Meanwhile, his adam’s apple went up and down once, and he sighed before opening his eyes.

The eyes did not return.

Dangerous.


Chapter 11

“Captain, I”

“Sally, should I cut your lips next?”

He lifted the hand holding her chin and paused.

Don’t say he remembered? Does he know her true identity?

She had to be prepared for unforeseen circumstances. Sally put her right hand in the pocket of her skirt, cautiously so he wouldn’t notice.

“No, what am I talking about now? Right?”

“Captain!”

Sally was dragged near his chin with no room to resist.

“You can bite it yourself and cut it.”

As Camden’s vampire smiled, revealing his white teeth, Sally covered her mouth with her left hand. A scuffle broke out with the man who was about to remove her hand and swallow her lips.

No matter how hard she had been trained, it was impossible to defeat a military officer whose physique was exceptionally good with one hand. She wasn’t yet ready to use her last resort. So, eventually, Sally had to pull out her right hand from her pocket—the last resort she held, and mobilize it in the fight.

Winston grabbed her wrist as she tried to stab him in the eye. He then wrapped his arm around Sally’s waist and lifted her up.

The moment her body floated in the air and was placed on a hard object, Sally kicked, and the papers and pens neatly laid out on the desk fell onto the carpet.

Her foot slammed Winston’s chin as targeted, but he only grimaced for a moment.

“You fought well. Do you have any brothers? Or, where did you get your training?”

She stiffened as she twisted her ankle, which was caught by Winston. If she fought, her identity would be revealed. If she didn’t fight, she would have to sleep with that filthy royal pig.

Sally’s breathing was harsh as she searched for a way in her confused head. When she stopped her resistance, Winston smiled as he ran a few strands of her hair that had run down her forehead from the fight and moved it back.

Contrary to his calm demeanor, his body was even hotter, and the front of his trousers bulged even higher than before.

“I am still curious. What you and I can do.”

“Captain, please let me go.”

“Why? Oh, yes.”

Sally’s resolute refusal was taken lightly by Winston. His clean hands buried inside his officer’s jacket, then pulled out the black object and placed it on her chest, which was lying on the desk.

“I am a person who is sure of reciprocation.”

What he gave was a heavy wallet full of bills. He was a man who hated women who spread their legs in front of money, but why did he give her the money and force her to spread her legs?

Was his test not over yet

“Captain, it must have been about what happened during the day. I have someone to marry. I don’t want to betray him.”

Ignoring Sally’s pleas, his hand popped into the hem of her skirt and rolled up over her lap.

“Sally, the more you say that, the hotter it gets. You don’t know men No, you know me too well.”

“Captain! Stop—!”

It was when he was about to press on a sensitive point. His hand, which was running up her thigh, grabbed something, and Sally froze in fright. The light smile on Winston’s face disappeared in an instant.

“Whatis it?”

The object stuck under the band of the right stocking came out at once. Sally’s heart fluttered as the silver revolver exposed its muzzle outside her black skirt.

‘Calm down. You have to be calm.’

Winston held the revolver in front of him as Sally slowly raised her torso. The cold gaze of the absurdly small pistol in his hand turned over to her face.

“What is this, I asked.”

‘It’s a pistol.’

If she behaved like an idiot, his shallow patience might be completely exhausted today. After he lost his temper, even Winston wouldn’t know her fate.

“My fiancé gave it to me.”

“Your fiancé gave you a forbidden thing.”

After the monarchy was restored, civilians were not allowed to possess firearms unless they had special permission from the police or military. It was because they feared a second rebellion.

“What does he do? Is he like a back alley gangster?”

“He is not that kind of person. He is a good man.”

Winston’s sleek brow wrinkled as she sided with her fiance with a half-serious, half-plausible performance.

“Since I work in the torture chamber, it was dangerous, so he just wanted to help me from something dangerous. I know it’s forbidden, Captain. but”

“Dangerous Sally, no one will touch you in this mansion. I have given a strong warning.”

You are touching me.

Sally swallowed the words that filled her throat.

Winston’s right hand, standing inside the bloomer’s left edge, was still lightly gripping her bare skin.

“You must be the only one gutsy enough to disobey me.”

Was he talking about going into the torture chamber alone during the day? His lips raised and he smiled. But his eyes were not smiling.

“I’m sorry.”

Sally lowered her head, dropping her gaze like a gentle sheep. She was such a docile sheep that she seemed to have to live like that until the headquarters gave an order to evacuate.

Though she was suddenly startled when his thumb, buried in her bloomer, stroked the inside of her thigh once.

Was he going to attack her again? He was a human being who threatened to use illegal weapon possession more as an excuse. No, he was a human being who started attacking her without any excuse.

When she opened her eyes slightly and peered into his eyes, Winston’s gaze was fixed on the revolver. Soon, his five fingers slipped out of her bare skin, leaving a brisk fiery trail in her stockings.

However, it was too early to be relieved.

Winston peered into every nook and cranny of the revolver. He opened the revolver’s magazine, pulled out the bullet, checked it, and found that the serial number that was supposed to be engraved between the magazine and the barrel had been erased, and he grinned.

Sally’s heart beat faster.

“Have you ever shot it?”

She had used firearms countless times, so there was no way she didn’t know. That revolver was a well-maintained item. If she said she never shot it or that her fiancé gave it to her, so she only had it, he would immediately know it was a lie.

“A couple of times Having fun with cans”

“And?”

“I met a robber in town a month ago”

“Did you get him right?”

“Yeah”

Winston burst into a burst of excited laughter and then asked.

“What about me?”

“Yes?”

“Did you try to shoot me?”

Sally stared into his eyes, which flashed with cruel playfulness, and then nodded slowly and resolutely. Regardless, if she said no, he would know it was a lie.

“Ha”

Winston burst into laughter again, but it was different from the laughter he had just had before. Laughing and biting his lower lip, she could vaguely feel a look of embarrassment at being caught off guard.

“Me? How funny.”

Snap, the magazine is closed. There was still a slight embarrassment in the words he uttered in a comical tone.

“If you shoot, you die.”

“Yes.”

“I have no intention of killing you.”

Sally struggled to compose her grim look.

Although he was trying to scare her, he was also trying to give her life. Should she say thank you? She had tried to kill her master, so did he want her to apologize?

“I’m having fun, don’t you think it’s fun?”

The corners of Winston’s eyes and lips drooped down. Anyone who didn’t know what the other person was doing would have thought that this sullen puppy-like expression would suit his well-groomed face.

He didn’t ask for an answer anyway, so Sally kept her mouth shut and stared at him. She was just busy looking for a way to get out with her breath intact.

“I think it would be fun to stir with this.”

He raised the revolver’s muzzle up and swung it through the air.

“It’s too small. Well, you’re small, too.”

The meaningless words continued, yet her intuition shouted that he was going to do something dangerous.

“Captain”

Sally sniffed, clutching her two hands so that her wrinkled apron crumpled even more. She had to put up with anything, even if it was an unreasonable number. Immediately, her tears dripped down the back of her pure white hand.

“Are you crying again?”

There was a hint of tiredness in Winston’s voice.

“Am I getting kicked out now?”

The moment she deliberately distorted her face and raised her head, Winston wrinkled his brow. His hand, holding his muzzle up, gradually tilted to the floor.

It worked.

Her mother said so. Tears tactic wouldn’t work if she used it too often. However, it depends on how she defines the definition of ‘work.’

“Please, don’t, sniff—kick me, out.”

As he was wiping her tears with her sleeve, Sally peered to see that the front of Winston’s trousers was sinking. Seeing that, he sobbed and cried even more.

“Caaptaainn, huuuck”

It was not fun.

Leon looked at the woman crying like a child with cold eyes and let out a sigh of anger. She was acting like a child, so neither her disheveled clothes nor her legs dangling helplessly from the end of the desk looked strange.

She had to bite him till the end.

A cornered mouse was only fun when it tried to bite the cat. Losing her courage completely and squeaking was just a drag. He’d rather have her try to kill him when he said he was going to kill her.

The atmosphere cooled down as time was wasted with the teasing.

“Go.”

At the blunt command, the woman lifted her face buried in her sleeve.

Rounded eyes, red-tinted shades, and nostrils twitching from sniffling It was like a mouse that seized the opportunity.

‘Go for it. Run away from me.’

Leon smacked his lips quietly like a cat just before it attacked its prey.

Chapter 12
“Am I being kicked out?”

Something like a silly little mouse

A long sigh escaped the teeth that pressed his lower lip.

If she ran away as if she had waited for him to go, he would try to catch her and knock her down on the carpet because he would be tempted again. However, what if she asked him if she was going to be kicked out?

Sally would be so pathetic that even the slightest bit of interest had cooled off.

“I won’t kick you out. So, please go.”

“Th, thank you.”

The maid came down under the desk, hesitatingly thanking him. Leon walked over to the chair without paying attention and opened the desk drawer.

“The gun is confiscated.”

After putting the revolver in the drawer and closing it roughly, the maid turned her wrinkled face toward the door.

Leon leaned heavily against the heavy chair and sat down.

He repeated as he watched the maid slip out of the door like a mouse. In the first place, he was just letting her go for a while. It was fun to chase after she ran away, so he was just letting her go on purpose.

But, why didn’t it have a pleasant aftertaste, like a mouse that untangled the trap and ran away?

Glancing at the tightly closed door, Leon shifted his gaze to the desk that had been swept away by a storm. When the woman left and the fever went down, he felt pathetic that he had lost his mind like a rutting dog.

What was even about that lowly, wretched woman?

However, that didn’t last long.

The reason he lost his mind was that she had everything spread out on the desk. Leon picked up a silk handkerchief that had been lying around beside the wallet, which Sally had left behind. Because it was white, the red bloodstain in the middle stood out even more.

The moment the faint smell of blood awakened his sense of smell, his tongue remembered the taste.

The exhilarating taste of licking a cold muzzle, the dizzying smell of death stinging his nose, but the warmth and faint beat that shouts that it is still alive.

An old memory revived in his mind as he recalled the taste of the maid’s blood.

Now, it had faded to black and white, though only the girl’s dark brown hair, turquoise eyes, and red drops of blood on her lips were as clear as a colorful postcard from a resort.

A bitter smile engraved on Leon’s lips as he remembered the girl’s last cry.

His naive childhood ended on that day. The blood he tasted the first time he ran away from the tight duty of being the eldest son of the family—the bloody smell he smelled from his father, who met a tragic end the next day.

A brief vacation at Abbington Beach as a child completely changed the meaning of blood in his life.

Deviation.

It was a pity that his first deviance and his father’s last deviance had a bad ending. After that, Leon couldn’t resist the urge to taste the blood again.

“Dirty pig!”

The path had already been set before he was able to express his own will, but it was right to walk the path of a soldier. Deviations made for private interest soon become public achievements.

Should he thank a girl named Daisy?

Daisy.

It was a cute name that didn’t really suit her dark skin and bold temper.

Actually, Sally might be her real name. Every time he gazed into Sally’s eyes, he was skeptical. Although her skin color was much whiter than that of the girl, and brown hair was common, turquoise eyes were uncommon.

If Sally was that girl, he finally found the reason why he lost his temper and wanted to hang her on the hook and chain her slender neck with a chain.

Sally This name was too cute unbefitting her nerves.

Leon re-opened the drawer he had closed roughly.

A small revolver was placed next to a closet of medals his father had left behind. When he asked if she was about to shoot, without a moment’s hesitation, she nodded her head sternly. It was a fun woman to tease as she was without fear.

Recalling that, he smiled quietly and picked up the revolver.

When would she try to shoot?

Perhaps, it was when she was about to kick between his legs right before he found the gun?
Rather, since when did she make up her mind to shoot him? Every time she ran into him, was she slowly pulling out the muzzle stuck in the band of that old stocking?

Just before he was about to kiss her, he suddenly remembered Sally putting her right hand carefully in her pocket.

She was a fox pretending to be stupid A fox stupid enough to get caught.

Sally Bristol.

She was seemingly docile, though she hid dangerous things under a well-groomed skirt, and she was a dangerous maid who was thinking of shooting him. She was a brazen woman, yet she took money from him.

Among those under his command, she was the most selfish person while diligently doing what she was asked to do.

As he laid out the definitions one by one, it felt unnatural, like forcing different puzzles to fit together. So, why did he keep getting hung up on it?

Leon placed the silver revolver in the middle of the desk and lowered his hand to his waist. The belt buckle quickly unbuckled, and the buttons that were about to bounce off the front of the pants came out one by one from the narrow hole.

He wanted to take off the owner of that pistol. He wanted to look inside that woman as she was.

His hand, holding the handkerchief stained with the woman’s blood and tears, naturally turned downward. Soon, the sound of a soft cloth rubbing against his skin broke the silence of the office. A sweet sigh escaped between his smooth lips.

“Dirty pig!”

Would Sally curse him like that girl?

When she fell naked on the cold metal table in the torture chamber and her handcuffed arms and legs at the corners

He wished she hadn’t shrieked as she had just a moment ago, although screamed and howled with all her might, twisting her limbs and it echoing in the torture chamber.

It was sweet just imagining it.

Leon leaned his elbows against the armrests of the chair and clenched his chin, and glanced down. Dark watermarks appeared on the white cloth that wrapped around the copper-colored tip. The more he moved his hand, the more it spread and permeated the woman’s red traces.

Where should he start first?

Her mouth wouldn’t be bad.

Recalling his previous impressions, it was soft, moist, warm, and quite good. To be more honest, it was quite impressive that when he pressed her tongue with his index finger, she rather wrapped around his fingers and sucked it.

First, he would grab her chin to the side and shove himself between those tiny pink lips — Deep. Rough — Until her lips lose their pink color and turn blue. Her narrowed throat would squeeze and tighten as she swallowed a chunk of hard flesh instead of a soft breath.

What would be next?

Leon breathed, imagining the next place to be tormented, and moved even harsher. He hung his straight index finger in the knot of the black tie that was tightening his neck and pulled it loosely.

On his handkerchief, the clotted blood was oozing out with his liquid. Sally’s traces of blood, which spread out through the clear marks, clung to Leon’s most sensitive point. The mysterious smell of a mixture of a woman’s blood and his own fluid stimulated his sensitive sense of smell.

He gave strength to his hand, rubbing the handkerchief, imagining Sally’s blood dripping onto his genitals.

Was the flesh that blocked the narrow path pink like the lips?

If he held her thin waist with both hands and aligned the tip of his manhood with the flesh, she would cry out. She would try to close her legs that couldn’t be closed because of the handcuffs, without knowing how lascivious she was shaking her breasts

Then, he would suggest to her, generously, if she begged him to quit, she could quit.

When that happened, would she tremble and beg with all kinds of flattery right now?

In fact, he would pull her back down suddenly, saying there was no need for such a thing. If he tore through the flesh at once with his body, Sally would pour all kinds of curses on him with the mouth that was begging.

Would the texture be as good as her mouth? Leon clenched his hand and recalled the moment he stirred her mouth.

He was going to put it all in one go in those moist walls until a gasp of breath escaped between Sally’s torn lips.

He would slowly, very slowly, pull out the genitals buried in its hot flesh to the tip of its roots. Let the copper-colored skin be dyed with a beautiful blood color.

“Ha”

Leon let out a sigh as the white and cloudy liquid burst out, and soaked in bloodstains. It wasn’t just a feeling of relief that he had resolved the desire that had been bothering him all day.

“Didn’t I say that you’re annoying because you’re nice?”

The woman had misunderstood the meaning of his words that she was annoying. Still, it was annoying that she couldn’t be put in the torture chamber because she was nice.

He couldn’t quite get it right.

No matter how infamous a torturer he may be, he had his own principles. First, women were not tortured. Second, he would not bring an innocent person to the torture chamber.

It was a problem for Sally to get caught up in both of these principles.

Even if you grab and tear off the leg of a worker ant carrying a piece of bread that was diligently walking its way, and by the time the third leg got torn off, it would become dull. It was no different from unilaterally torturing a good child.

‘In order to be punished, there must be a crime worthy of it.’

Picking up the revolver that had been placed on the desk as if it was a lewdly painted picture. Even though illegal possession of firearms was also a clear sin, it was because it was such a trivial sin that he would not use it as an excuse.

Since the ban was less than a century ago, there were still many people caught by the police for carrying firearms for self-defense as was the old custom. His mother must have been hiding a female revolver in one of her many hat boxes.

Sally, do something worse

Because I want to teach you a lesson.

Chapter 13
“Should I have let you shoot?”

Leon put the revolver back into the drawer and closed it. He didn’t lock it with a key.

Stealing would be a slightly bigger sin. Besides, disobeying the master might be a felony within the walls of this mansion. Could it be an excuse to break the rules and drag her to the torture chamber?

Thinking that, he twisted his lips and narrowed his eyes sharply.

Bloodstains that were fading caught his gaze.

Perhaps, it was not the eyes. Maybe it was just the smell of blood. So, even if she was another woman, would he be so lustful if she smelled of blood?

That was a hell of a taste.

He smiled bitterly and stood up. The carpet was a mess of shards and ashes from the shattered ashtray. Tomorrow morning the maid would clean up this mess with grumbles towards him.

Leon unrolled a ‘message’ of encouragement to the maid and dropped it on the carpet.

 


 
The sun shone softly through the wooly clouds. Her dark brown hair fluttered in the wind, gleaming in the shattering sunlight.

It was a perfect day to go out.

April’s weather was as unpredictable as the Winston’s though, although she didn’t know what kind of whimsical it would bring. It was a ten-minute bike ride from the Winston Mansion to Halewood, the nearest town.

Sally parked her bike in front of a three-story brick building past the general store with a large discount sign.

Just when the lunch break was over, she met the post office manager who was turning the “closed” sign hanging on the window to ‘open.’ A middle-aged man raised his glasses with his index finger and gave her a glance before opening the door right away.

“Good afternoon, Miss Bristol.”

“Hello.”

Sally stopped as she stepped inside.

The post office in this small town had four employees, including the director, but today, for some reason, there were only three.

“Is it Mister Peter’s have a day off?”

“The postal train is late today, so he’s at the station.”

Peter spent the whole day in the village disguised as a postman, although he always eats lunch here. Because of that, she purposely came on time but apparently not today.

Then, she brought the money she got from Winston yesterday to send to headquarters for military funds. She entrusted the remittance to Peter, and he made it untraceable. For other employees, it was risky to disclose the addressee, even with disguised information.

“If you wait a minute, he’ll be there soon, haha.”

As Sally gripped the straps of her old bag and sighed, the postmaster grinned as he rubbed his long mustache with his fingertips. The people at the post office thought Sally had a rosy crush on Peter.

No way.

Even though she behaved modestly because of her duties, her eyes on men were not that simple either.

‘Shall we spend some time, then?’

Two buildings from here, she would find Madame Benoa’s Cafe. It had been a long time since she wanted to indulge in a little luxury.

As a middle-aged woman dragged three of her young children into the cramped post office, it soon became noisy with the voices of the woman and the children. Sally was about the leave, but she went into the corner phone booth.

She closed the door tightly and squinted out the small window in the door. They were all busy with their business, so they didn’t even look at her this way. Draping her butt on the chair in her corner, she found the purse in her bag and opened it.

She didn’t just take one, two, or three biggest coins.

She sighed as she was about to pick up the four. Normally, Sally didn’t make long-distance calls because it was expensive. Still, this was important, so she couldn’t help it.

She picked up the earpiece that seemed like the bottom of a candlestick, put it to her ear, and put money into the coin slot. As soon as she turned one of the dials, the chirping voice of a young woman resounded in her ears.

[ This is a long-distance call. ]

“Hello. This is Halewood’s Blackburn.”

Sally leaned over to the speaker on the phone.

Blackburn The name the operator would pass on to the other person meant a withdrawal request.

“Please, call Crawford 1499 in Brayton.”

Subsequently, she gave the name of the area and the name of the exchange company of the other party.

[ Please wait a moment. ]

After the operator’s voice, there was only a mechanical clicking sound that continued for a long time.

At the same time, she sneaked out of the booth nervously.

The woman who had brought her children started chatting with the woman behind the desk as if she would not leave even after all her parcels had been sent. Seeing that, Sally hoped that she would keep the place noise for the next ten minutes.

‘Yes, it’s worth kicking her ass.’

Although she spent an hour alone arguing with the chatter that faintly leaked into the booth, she couldn’t hear her partner’s voice. Rubbing her hand on the bag strap that had faded due to scratches here and there, someone came into the post office door.

Just as she raised her head, thinking it was Peter, she heard a familiar voice.

[ Halewood’s Blackburn? ]

Without asking who it was, Sally’s fiancée recited the code for the withdrawal request.

“That’s right.”

[ What? You? ]

He was a bit surprised since he was expecting Peter or Fred’s voice in Halewood.

[ What’s going on? ]

He went to the point without saying a greeting to his fiancée, whom he had not heard from in a long time. Since the operator may still be listening to the call, a conversation that obscured everything without calling a name followed.

“I want to go home.”

Jimmy would know. He would know that sarcastic tone was just a disguise because Sally never acted like a child.

[ What’s the matter? What about mother’s hospital bills? ]

The phrase ‘mother’s hospital bills’ had to be changed to ‘your mission.’

“The employer is weird.”

[ Weird? What are you talking about? ]

“Did you forget what I said before I came here?”

She couldn’t have forgotten that she warned that Winston would pierce her ear for her encounter with Winston at Abbington Beach as a child.

A long sigh was heard over the receiver.

[ But, you haven’t been cut yet. ]

He meant she was not cut yet because she wasn’t arrested.

“I might be cut soon.”

[ No. You’re good. There would be no evidence anyway. Is it not so? ]

This time Sally let out a long sigh on the speaker.

[ I need you. ]

Jimmy knew very well what his fiancée was weakest to in words. After all, they grew up together from when she was a baby, so she was like his real sibling.

“Still”

Sally took a deep breath before stopping. She didn’t want to tell anyone—no, she didn’t want to tell her fiancé more than anyone else Nonetheless, she had to.

After a momentary hesitation, she shut her eyes tightly and let a breath out.

“Yesterday, he tried to attack me.”

A silence continued on the other side of the receiver. What thoughts were going through his mind right now, five hours away by train?

Worried about his lover who almost got raped? A determination to get her out of Winston’s filthy grasp right away? Anger at the filthy beast who tried to assault his fiancé?

Perhaps, disappointment for a comrade who ruined the operation by being impure in the eyes of the target?

[ Really? ]

It was all wrong. Sally burst into anger.

“Would I lie about this?”

[ No, you know that’s not what I meant. With the person I know it doesn’t fit. ]

There was no way Jimmy, the leader of the Revolutionary Army, was unaware of Winston, a first-class state figure’s characteristics. The consistent information was that even though he was a man of filthy manners, his lower body was clean.

That was why he put his fiancé into Winston’s stronghold safely.

However, it was the first time a statement that contradicted the consistent information came out of Sally’s mouth. Aside from disappointment, she knew well that it was something that was hard to believe at once.

She added some more to Jimmy to add to a sense of urgency.

“I lost what I hid under my skirt.”

[ But, you’re not cut off? ]

“That’s why it’s even more dangerous.”

Only Winston treated her differently. She couldn’t quite predict what was going to happen next.

Sally pondered, waiting silently for Jimmy’s answer.

Should she tell him something else? It wasn’t enough that Winston had sucked her blood yesterday, so he left on the office floor evidence of him pleasuring himself with a handkerchief that had wiped her blood.

Even though he was a fiancé who was like her family, this story was too humiliating for her.

“I don’t have time.”

It was because the phone bill would run out soon.

A heavy sigh was heard over the receiver, and Jimmy gave the order in a voice calling for his lover.

[ I’m going to my friend’s house. I’ll talk to some adults and call you. ]

It meant he had to discuss it with the executives, so he told her to wait in a safe house in Winsford which was an hour by tram from here.

Sally immediately hung up the phone and walked out of the booth. Should she send the money next time? Peter hadn’t come back yet, anyway.

In the end, she greeted the postmaster and headed out of the post office.

Chapter 14
On the way to the tram stop, she stopped by Madame Benoa’s cafe.

“Pack this and this, please.”

Due to her tight pocket conditions, two pieces of cake at a high-end cafe were unreasonable. However, she wanted to give Fred’s older sister and childhood friend, Nancy, who works in the safe house, a little luxury.

The bike was tied to a pole at the tram stop and loaded onto the tram heading to Winsford. As she sat by the window and looked out, the idyllic landscape of sheep grazing soon turned into a gigantic factory area emitting black smoke.

It was once an apple orchard.

Although the landlord cut down all the apple trees a decade ago and sold them to an auto parts company.

As technology advanced, those who owned the land became richer and those who farmed the land became poorer. After being kicked out of the farm and working intensively without seeing sunlight for dozens of hours in a factory, the meager wages they get are usually wasted as medicine.

The building that passed in front of her slowly rose. The gap between the rich and the poor, which was inconspicuous in small rural villages, became more pronounced as it approached large cities.

Sally got off the tram when she saw the grand opera house.

Walking through the crowd busily on her way, she came across a large department store. A young woman, with colorful sable fur over her shoulders, unsuitable for the mild weather, was walking towards the sidewalk taxi stop, holding the hand of a boy about ten years old.

In the child’s hand was a train set that was recently made famous by the youngest prince as a gift from a foreign royal family. A boy of the same age standing by the side of the road was glancing at it with unfocused eyes.

A piece of cardboard was hung from the neck of the child, with coal soot smeared on the child’s face.

Seeing that, Sally took some of the bills from her money, which she was going to send as a military fund, and handed it to the child.

The child widened his eyes, though he did not take the money willingly.

“What’s going on?”

It meant giving a large sum of money without any bargaining to get the child to do something tough.

“I’m just giving.”

Blinking his eyes like a frightened puppy, he slowly reached out his hand, blackened under the fingernails.

The kindness that he did not expect was rather terrifying.

Swish.

The money was snatched from Sally’s hand. As soon as the child grabbed the money, he ran away without a thank you. He was running away because the stranger might change his mind and ask for the money back or drive him as a thief.

Distrust was not just confined to the child’s mind.

On the other hand, she also had to leave quickly. It was because the child could have a bad heart, drag bad guys in, and rob her instead. She had to be more careful now that she didn’t have a gun.

In the end, she decided to use the department store as a detour.

Ahead of Easter, the department store was decorated in a cute and colorful way, like a fairy tale world.

‘Come to think of it, I have to buy stockings’

The stockings that Winston ripped yesterday because he couldn’t just make a hole in them are useless now.

Sally approached the shelf where the stockings were displayed. The clerk, who was counting on the ledger lifted the corner of her eye, which had been pulled out with black eyeliner, slightly to look at her before glancing down at the book again.

The clerk’s eyes were not wrong. The luxury stockings in the department store were not for her.

Sally pretended she didn’t like the stockings that she had picked up, so she let them go and turned away. On her way back to the mansion, she would need to see if there were rayon stockings on sale at Halewood’s general store.

As soon as she turned the corner, she suddenly stopped.

It was because of the reflection of her humble self in the glass. An old light gray cardigan, a white blouse with an unembroidered round collar, a navy pleated skirt to the knee, and a worn brown leather bag

Standing behind the glass was a mannequin dressed in a gorgeous dress, perhaps ten times her weekly wage, making her look modest and shabby.

“Don’t grow up prettily. Don’t even decorate yourself prettily. Don’t let anyone see you.”

Her mother’s voice resounded in Sally’s head as she had been imagining herself in that gorgeous dress.
‘After all, I’m not the kind of beauty that makes all the men on the street look back at me like my mother.’

It was the Revolutionary Army community that raised Sally, as her mother was away for a long time due to her mission. Occasionally, she came back to the house once in a while, and she pretended to be asleep when she was back.

It was because if she was awake, her mother was always hard on her in front of others. Sitting on her bed, she would stroke her hair when she fell asleep. It was a gentle touch that she would not normally feel.

“Don’t grow up prettily. Don’t even decorate yourself prettily. Don’t let anyone see you.”

Her mother always repeated the same words like a mantra. Those words were not just meaningless monologues of drunkenness, so when someone bought Sally cosmetics or pretty accessories, she hated them and even threw them in the trash.

Even when her father bought her a red lipstick for Sally’s fifteenth birthday, she was so enraged that she even threw the wine glass at him.

When she was young, she was sad, too. Her mother’s dresser drawer was full of colorful cosmetics, and her closet was full of expensive dresses and shoes that she didn’t know where the money came from.

‘Then, why did you do that to me?’

Even though she wanted to ask that, her mother was not of this world.

Whatever the reason, it did not change the fact that her mother was a great Revolutionary Army member.

‘You are a great Revolutionary Army member, too.’

Sally looked down at her reflection in the glass and smiled faintly. Riding her bike, she combed her hands neatly through the tangled hair a little.

This was the path she had chosen.

 


 
A very heavy silence settled in the sedan that had left Winsford’s western headquarters and started running toward Govurn.

A low voice mixed with laughter broke it.

“At this rate, I’ll only have bones.”

Leon turned his gaze outside his car window to his superior, Colonel Humphrey, who sat in the seat next to him. There was no need to ask whom he was talking about. Even in his mind, the Western commander was already screaming at the site of Govurn’s attack with a sullen face.

“Moderate weight loss is good for your health.”

“If only I could live longer.”

The fact that the driver and the mistress turned out to be rebel spies meant that the commander’s future was on a precipice.

Nevertheless, while escorting one of the spies to the camp, they were attacked by the rebels and missed. The convoy also suffered casualties. If the commander was summoned to the royal court, the reprimand he would face was doubled.

The commander had lost his modesty and dignity as a soldier and was left with only greed. Leon was always disgusted, but these days, he seemed pitiful.

“I’d like to see Harris’ face.”

The lieutenant colonel laughed, mentioning the commander of the convoy. The intelligence agency in charge of the lieutenant colonel was not responsible for this incident, so he was laughing like a stranger.

But, could he say it like it was someone else’s business?

Leon stared sharply at the back of Lieutenant Campbell’s head in the passenger seat.

How did he know that the destination was Govurn?

They didn’t dispatch personnel to follow the convoy and hit it. While waiting on the outskirts of Govurn, a convoy was attacked. The raid was organized and meticulous. Consequently, this meant that they knew in advance when the convoy would take place

Information leaked out somewhere.

This may not be the first time.

A few months ago, the person who was discovered as a double agent was eliminated in just two days. In the end, doubts turned into certainty. Of course, the information could have leaked from the convoy or other divisions of the command.

‘Though what if?’

If anyone under his command had informed them, his path would be precipitous.

‘That won’t do.’

He wasn’t naive enough to just hope it wasn’t. He had to find it and bury it before the superiors could find it. It meant that the body of the person who reported it should also be buried somewhere after asking the subordinate to inform him of it.

‘Campbell?’

Leon softened his gaze as he stared at Campbell’s back.

That person couldn’t do that.

After all, the Campbells were vassals of the Winstons for hundreds of years. Now that their vassal status was gone, they were running a military business with the help of the Winstons. Lieutenant Campbell was a dog that Leon handcrafted from the Campbell family that he could play to his heart’s content.

‘I have to give you orders.’

After arriving at Govurn, he was planning to give instructions if the lieutenant colonel was absent. Keep track of the latest trends in the soldiers stationed in the annex and the latest development in the domestic intelligence department Leon is in charge of.

‘And’

Leon’s pupils, who inadvertently turned his head out of the window, widened in an instant.

‘Why is that woman over there?’

Chapter 15
The maid was standing on the crowded sidewalk.

In the midst of a large crowd of people rushing by, the woman was rummaging through her brown handbag, unknown what she was doing. He wouldn’t have recognized her if he hadn’t thought that her back was strangely familiar as she didn’t wear her usual black maid outfit and her hair, which was always pulled up, was also loose.

‘It’s annoying because it’s nice.’

Leon’s brow furrowed. The woman took her bills from the handbag and handed them to the beggar in front of the department store.

‘I heard your mother’s hospital bills aren’t enough?’

She spent money on beggars when she wore holed old stockings.

‘You’re so relaxed?’

What he did at lunchtime today was about to become pathetic.

“A beauty that makes you turn your head.”

The lieutenant colonel suddenly spoke, and Leon straightened his head, which he had turned without realizing it.

“Have you seen a pretty girl?”

“No.”

“You know how to behave well, but are you in your prime? Like a bee in a jar of honey, you will be twisted by a beautiful woman. You better be careful, so you don’t end up like the commander.”

Well Leon was sure he wouldn’t be like the commander because he was not a pathetic bastard who couldn’t recognize a spy and just liked the smell of a female.

“At my time, a naughty blonde fox squirmed around”

The lieutenant colonel bit his mouth all of a sudden. It was only now that he remembered that Leon was the son of the man who had lost his life after being deceived by that blonde fox.

“That woman, she died a few years ago. Did you hear?”

“Yes.”

“I’m sorry. For what she did, she got it too easy.”

The lieutenant colonel rummaged through his jacket pocket and pulled out a cigar case. He muttered, biting off the end of the cigar.

“Leon”

Calling in a friendly way as if Leon was his son, he offered him a cigar. Leon was polite enough to not be offended by the lieutenant colonel. Then, the thick hand holding the cigar tapped his shoulder and backed away.

“Catch that woman’s children and show her example in hell. Even Major Winston in Heaven will be proud of you.”

The woman had two children with the surname Riddle, the ‘royal family’ of the rebels. The eldest son, like ‘Little Jimmy’, was expected to take over his father’s footsteps and lead the leadership, but as soon as both his parents died, he turned his back on the rebels.

He had given up all the power and wealth that was given to the top officials and becomes a farmworker in a rural area. Although he disguised himself, it didn’t take long for Leon to track him down and find him.

The rat must be caught But, what about the apostate rat?

People were only attached to watch him because the leader of the rebels or his younger sister would one day approach him so that the rat released could attract more rats.

“If Little Riddle is caught, it will be worth watching. There are over ten people in the West alone who are grinding their teeth on Riddle’s rats.”

Of the infamous Riddle’s rats, there was now only one left.

Little Riddle.

The real name, appearance, and age have not been revealed.

So far, whenever he questioned the rebels, he had not forgotten and asked about the last Riddle, though none of them said anything. It seemed that the rebel leader, whom he did not know who he was, was more scary than the torture engineer standing in front of them with a blunt-bladed nipper.

What the hell was she like?

So, the military called the mysterious woman Little Riddle, which meant ‘a small mystery.’

If she resembled her mother, was she a beauty with blonde hair and hazel eyes? She was probably just as cunning and vicious as her mother. Perhaps, she must be selling herself to military officers somewhere to get information.

 


 
She slipped out the back door of the department store and walked through a cobweb-tangled alley. The other side of the colorful downtown was gray. It was followed by shabby buildings inhabited mainly by the poor working class. Only the sound of Sally’s shoes echoed through the empty alley.

No one looked at her until she reached the red brick building in the back alley.

For the people here, even being curious about the lives of others was a luxury. They went to work before sunrise and returned only after sunset. That was why they put a safe house in such a backward and underdeveloped place.

If the safe house were in a place where the middle class lives, it would be easily detected.

There would always be people who ran out and looked out the window to find out what gossip was in the neighborhood. It was the worst location in the house where other faces had no choice but to come and go.

Sally stood in front of the black door with the paint peeling off and rang the doorbell.

[ Get away, you motherfucker. ]

Rough words came out of the speaker. Hearing that, she twisted her brow slightly.

“Nancy, it’s me.”

[ Ah ]

The speaker went off with a click, and footsteps were heard running down the stairs from behind the door.

Soon, the door swung open and brown eyes peered into her.

Nancy grabbed Sally inside and dragged her inside after reaffirming that she was her friend.

“I thought they were the neighborhood kids again There are guys these days who have fun ringing the doorbell and running away.”

As Sally followed her up the old stairs, the house overlooking the alley on the right on the third floor was inside.

Even during the brief time she came down to open the door, Nancy kept the door firmly locked. She walked through the small living room and into the kitchen, and before entering, she would put the locks back on one by one.

“What’s going on? Do you have a day off?”

“Yes.”

While Nancy prepared the cake she had brought on the little table, she turned on the radio that was placed on the wall shelf. Immediately, a brilliant trumpet playing came out and covered the sound of the two of them.

Whoever was behind the thin walls would not be able to overhear the conversation.

“Actually, Jimmy decided to call me over here.”

“Why? What’s going on?”

To withdraw.

Then, she would ask why she wanted to withdraw. Sally was worried that the reason might accidentally get into the ears of Fred, Nancy’s younger brother and Winston’s subordinate. She still didn’t know what she was going to do because he was an immature guy.

“It’s no big deal.”

“Hmm. But, what is this?”

Nancy frowned and tapped her fingertips next to her lips. Sally, noticing that she was referring to the scar on her cheek, frowned and turned her back.

“I was scratched at work. Do you have coffee more than that?”

Soon, the two chatted in front of a steaming mug and two pieces of cake. Sally cut the cake with a fork and put it in her mouth.

An almond cake filled with vanilla custard cream between cake sheets topped with caramelized almond slices.. This cake was the culprit that made her salivate even just by the name of Madame Benoa. She admired the taste of the sweet clouds melting in the fragrant sunlight.

“Isn’t it fantastic?”

“Is it a wonder that such a talented person is hiding in such a corner?”

Nancy tasted the other cake topped with raspberry jelly and nodded her head.

“It’s because of the Winston family. Every time they have a party, they put in a lot of orders.”

“Oh, by the way, how is Fred doing?”

“Yes, I don’t think it’s a big deal.”

She didn’t tell her yesterday that he almost got whipped by Winston.

“Ugh, I’m worried about that guy because he’s timid.”

“Though He must have been shocked by Uncle Bobby.”

She remembered Fred running out of the torture chamber a few days ago, where his uncle’s screams echoed. His face was so pale blue. Sally later went so far as to ask how he was holding up with this every time she was alone.

“Still, what about uncle? How is he?”

“How is it? The elite troops went to the rescue.”

Nancy smirked as she waved her hand as if seeing she was worried for nothing.

“Where is he now?”

“Inside Billford’s safe house.”

“Is he okay?”

She suddenly asked as if she remembered.

Her scornful eyes stared at her, asking if he had any leaked information. She felt uncomfortable because it seemed as if she had left a residue of a misunderstanding with a man she had not seen for a long time.

“Oh, no. I’ll have to make a call.”

“The long-distance is expensive, so keep it short.”

“I know.”

Sally went out to the living room and sat down on the sofa.

Then, she rummaged through an old notebook hidden under the sofa cushions, looking for the code of Billford’s safe house. Eventually, she immediately picked up the receiver from the phone placed on the coffee table.

The operator’s voice and mechanical clicking sound were boring. That was not enough, she could only hear Uncle Bobby’s voice only after she heard a bunch of nagging from the aunt who was in charge of the house, that it was no rush.

“Uncle, it’s me. How is your body?”

[ Oh, yes. Now that I’m alive, I must say it’s worth living. ]

Although the voice over the receiver was a little murky, there was a return of vitality that she couldn’t feel in the torture room.

“That’s fortunate.”

[ Thank you for your concern. ]

“Absolutely. You are like my family.”

No matter how accustomed she was to this sort of thing, Sally had a warm heart. She couldn’t be happier that the mission had forced her to face hardships soberly.

“Then, take a good rest, recover your health quickly. And, when you return to the house, say my hello to Aunt Hattie”

Uncle Bobby abruptly interrupted her as she was saying goodbye to hang up the phone.

What was the point of calling her real name rather than her disguised name, even with a very low voice?

“Yes?”

[ Are you playing the role of the devil’s mistress? ]

Chapter 16
“What?”

Sally was momentarily speechless at his astonishing speculation. Perhaps, it was because Winston was friendly with her in the torture chamber, and it got misunderstood?

“Uncle, there’s no way I can do that with that filthy bastard.”

[ Isn’t that the order from above? ]

“You know that such a task cannot be given from the upper level, even my fiancée.”

[ . ]

“Uncle.”

[ Are you in touch with Joe? ]

He asked if she had contact with her brother, who had left the comrade out of nowhere. Even though he was a family to Sally, he was a traitor to his comrades.

While she couldn’t answer and hesitated, the uncle made a request that she couldn’t understand.

[ Go to Joe. Then, don’t come again. ]

Sally didn’t know why he hung up the phone. She put the handset back in place and stared at the stain in the corner of the coffee table.

Maybe, it was because uncle’s mind and body got weak after he was tortured, or did she make the embarrassing mistake of standing shoulder to shoulder with her comrade? To leave them and never come back, she, who only knew revolution and comrades.

She thought about the uncle’s words blankly, then a bang on the wall saying the radio was noisy from next door made her spirit come to life.

Sally and Nancy chatted all afternoon over a cold coffee.

Nonetheless, fragments of the uncle’s words were still floating around in her head. When it was a time when a new topic of discussion fell and traced back to her childhood memories, finally, the phone rang.

“It took a long time.”

[ I’m sorry, but I’ll have to put the withdrawal on hold. ]

“Why? Is it dangerous?”

Sally burst into anger at the unexpected reply. He continued his word in a rather heavy voice without appeasing her.

[ Instead, you’re given a new mission. As always, I believe you will do well. ]

“What?”

[ I want you to listen calmly without getting angry. And, don’t forget that I love you. ]

As she listened to Jimmy’s words, Sally nervously twisted the wire on the handset and wet her dry lips. Was it a mission to die for?

“If it is worthwhile, I am willing to give my life honorably. So tell me.”

[ I want you to approach him. ]

Sally’s head tilted.

Approach him — Was it an illusion that his instructions sound strange?

“I don’t know what you mean. Am I not still doing that?”

Sally’s fiancé let out a long sigh and muffled his voice.

[ Did I say to see you as a woman? ]

At that moment, the pencil in her hand broke in two.

Beauty The revolutionary army does not use such dirty tricks.

“Are you out of your mind?”

As she raised her voice, she could hear the sound of a chair being pulled away from the kitchen. It looked like Nancy was coming this way.

[ You know this is a rare opportunity. It’ll be of great help in stopping him. Important information can also be accessed more easily. Besides, it’ll be easier to deal with when he’s useless someday. ]

“Nonsense.”

[ I don’t mean to sleep with him. ]

Sally smirked as she wiped her face down.

“Then? What do you mean if I don’t go that far?”

The moment she brought the receiver to her lips and scolded him, Nancy walked out of the kitchen. Sally turned her back from her friend, who leaned against the door frame with a worried face and wrapped her hand around the receiver.

[ It’s not like that. Avoid as much as you can and try to persuade him. Hopefully, you can control him. ]

“How am I going to avoid it? He’s not a normal thinker. How do I control him Are you talking about people like us?”

[ I don’t have time to argue. You don’t have to send money from now on. You will need it. ]

It meant buying the necessary cosmetics and clothes to seduce Winston on a weekly basis.

“What? I don’t need it. Why did you change like this? You’ve never used such a dirty trick before.”

[ You are too idealistic. Sometimes, I’m not sure if you really are my lifelong friend. ]

“What do you mean?”

[ I mean, I need confidence that you’ll understand whatever I tell you. Our job is dirtier, more painful, and more disgraceful than you think. Occasionally, it takes a painful dedication. ]

The more her fiancé continued to speak, the more Sally’s face changed from moment to moment.

[ You don’t think this is an excessive sacrifice, do you? Many people lose their lives, although I hope you are not just protecting yourself. ]

“You are my fiancé No, how can you say that when you know how serious I am about this?”

[ Please, understand that this was a difficult decision, too. You did that to me — Like your parents did, you want to become close comrades with me. Don’t forget, I love you. ]

Jimmy knew well what his fiancé was weakest in words.

Sally bit her lip as he drew the decisive card.

“I’ll hang up. I have to go before the train cuts off.”

It was still a bit early for the train to stop. However, as soon as Sally hung up the phone, she ran out of the safe house because she knew Nancy would ask her what was going on.

While walking towards the tram stop, stomping her feet as if to vent her anger on the innocent street, she could see the department store where she gave the boy money. She then stopped her steps.

Sally grabbed her bag and pondered for a moment before she crossed the boulevard and entered the post office.

There were already people lining up in the lobby of the post office, which was incomparably larger than that of Halewood’s, waiting for their turn. As the deadline approached, the post office workers were busy playing with their hands and did not pay attention to the customers who had just arrived.

She took the round sunglasses out of her bag and put them on. The black scarf was also tightly wrapped around her head and chin to cover her wounds before she stood at the end of the line.

After waiting for about thirty minutes, it was her turn. The gilt-rimmed employee glanced up at her and asked rudely.

“How can I help you?”

“I want to send money.”

Sally pulled out the wad of cash from her bag. The employee raised an eyebrow at the amount before giving her a piece of paper and a pen to write the sender and payee information on. While the man was counting the bills, she twisted the pen.

Remittances she sent through someone other than Peter may be tracked. Regardless, it was difficult to find the sender in a post office in such a bustling metropolis.

Filling out the application form, she handed it to the staff.

The long-scrambled addressee’s name was not Jimmy’s, though her brother’s. Meanwhile, Jimmy’s words echoed in her head again as she watched the staff busily moving his fingers over the typewriter.

[ You don’t have to send money from now on. You will need it. ]

Forget it. She didn’t need it.

In the end, the money taken from Winston was not used for the military funds of the headquarters or for Sally’s funds.

Her nephew, who she didn’t even know the face, would be able to spend a happy Easter that was a little comforting.

Even though she still wanted to go around because she still felt like it, now that she didn’t have a gun anymore, it would be dangerous for her to wander the dark night streets alone.

On her way back to the mansion from Halewood, her hair and clothes were wet and droopy from April’s whimsical showers. What could be more suitable for her to feel heavy and droopy?

Sally dragged her bike into the mansion’s employee-only back door. As the sun went down, the lights were dimming in the dark garden. She turned her back to the main building, where the bright lights were pouring out, and she walked towards the ugly annex.

Upon entering through the annex wall, it seemed that Winston’s car was not there.

She put her bike in the backyard shed and looked up, but the lights in the office and bedroom were also off.

He was not back yet?

The revolver, which was still ‘confiscated’ in the office drawer, flashed through her mind for a moment. Despite that, Sally immediately shook her head. He always locked the drawer, but he didn’t lock it today. He couldn’t have forgotten

That was a trap that was deliberately left open to steal.

With that thought, Sally let out a long sigh as she climbed the steps of the annex to the attic. She couldn’t even get a new gun.

Wherever she hides, Winston’s dirty hands will find it.

Tonight, for what reason was he going to call her to do some dirty work?

Rescue operations, bombing, robbing the royal family. She had taken on all kinds of challenging missions, however, this was the first time she felt like escaping.

‘Damn Jimmy Are you still my fiancé?’

Nevertheless, it was she who wanted to live with him as comrades, just like her parents.

‘But, this is not really the case.’

Sally stopped at the door of the maid’s room, pondering the contents of the call. A shopping bag from the department store she went to today was hanging on the doorknob.

No way, was Winston here?

Chapter 17
She glanced around and looked inside the maid’s room, but there was no one.

After Sally entered and locked the door, she glared at the luxurious shopping bag as if it was a ticking time bomb. After she pondered over and over again, she finally opened and squinted her eyes.

‘What kind of whim is this again?’

The first thing she took out was an ointment in a small box.

It was to apply to wounds on the face.

Since when did Winston pay so much attention to the wounds of a maid? Just in the mansion kitchen, there are a lot of maids who cut their hands, and he should send it there. He was not a normal thinker, so it wouldn’t mean an apology. What kind of trick was this?

Putting put the ointment box in the drawer and going through the shopping bag, inside were twelve flat, square boxes.

A vicious sigh escaped Sally’s mouth as she opened a box with a colorful pattern on it.

Silk stockings.

It was three times more expensive than what Sally picked up and placed this afternoon. It also contained three pairs of each color: black, white, brown, and peach.

Jimmy’s absurd command repeated in her mind as she stared at the twelve bomb boxes lying on her bed.

“Please don’t do this.”

 


 
A hum came out of Sally, who was cleaning out Winston’s annex dressing room. Govurn’s rescue operation was going to be an unexpected good fortune.

Winston went to Govurn the day after the operation and did not return until today, three days later.

‘Do not come back forever.’

A ray of scarlet sunset light leaked through the gap in the curtain that covered the long window. It seemed that he would not come back today, considering that even at dusk, Lieutenant Campbell had not made a call to prepare something for Winston’s.

Winston had been sleeping a lot in the annex bedroom rather than the main building in the past few months.

As a result, Sally was really busy as she took care of his personal belongings.mAs she picked up the officer’s uniform from the laundry cart and hung it neatly in the closet, she frowned as she recalled the gossip in the laundry room the other day.

“All the button threads are tattered.”

The maids in charge of the laundry smirked at the fact that Winston’s trousers had to be re-buttoned with strong thread. She was obviously referring to the pants he was wearing the day she attacked Sally.

“What made him so excited that the button broke?”

“Didn’t you hear that he had a date with the Grand Lady that day?”

Crazy bastard

He spent all evening with her fiancee and tried to attack the maid as soon as he returned.

“He’s tall, and his hands are big, so, hmm, would it be big?”

One of the maids whispered, the other clenched her fist and shook her forearm.

“It’s obvious just by looking at the stretched thread. Won’t it be this big? Don’t you think it must have been outstanding there, too?”

At that moment, without realizing it, Sally remembered the large ‘cigar’ and wrinkled her expression as if she had chewed an insect. Why the hell was they curious about the dirty parts of that garbage? Even though she didn’t want to know, it was just a shame she couldn’t undo it anymore.

Her cart was almost empty. All that was left were small items like socks and handkerchiefs.

Sally, who had inadvertently picked up the ironed and neatly folded white silk handkerchief from the basket, frowned again.

‘Is this that damned handkerchief?’

Originally, as soon as she found it, she put it on the stove and held back that she wanted to burn it. She thought of his eccentricity, and it was clear if she had burned what he had left behind on purpose, he was obviously going to investigate.

Sally tucked the handkerchief, all clean, in the middle of the tightly packed handkerchiefs in the drawer.

‘Shall I just get kicked out?’

She brought the laundry cart back to the ground floor and made her way up to the attic to get her share of dinner.

A good idea suddenly came to mind.

His engagement to the Grand Lady has not yet been finalized, although if there are rumors of an affair with an insignificant maid Mrs. Winston would drive her out at once.

So, it meant that she didn’t have to embark on a new mission, did she?

Nonetheless, her terribly terrifying sense of responsibility caught Sally’s ankle. She infiltrated the Winstons with difficulty and successfully. If she left without planting anyone, it would be like building a strong foundation and setting them on fire on the way home.

Even with Fred, frankly, he was untrustworthy. It was because Winston didn’t trust him. She didn’t know when he would act on a whim and send him to another unit or class.

‘Don’t ever come back. Or is he falling in love with another woman in Govurn Oh, why is this happening again?’

After the meal, Sally let out a long sigh as she went to the small bathroom attached to the maid’s room.

She turned on the shower valve, and no matter how long she waited, only ice-cold water poured out. There were times when the boiler in the basement of the annex was old, and the hot water did not come up to the attic.

The reward for hard work was an ice shower. She couldn’t stand it.

Even so, the bathroom under the attic was already as cold as ice.

Shivering in only her underwear, Sally stared at the pouring icy water and stopped the water. Sally put back the clothes she had taken off, grabbed the clothes to change into, and headed downstairs since Winston wasn’t coming anyway.

 


 
As the dancers climbed onto the stage, the whistle of the men drowned out the sound of the music. The only thing the female dancers wore was a short skirt with flamboyant tassels and beads, and a necklace of imitation pearls hung in layers around their neck.

Leon stared blankly at the women dancing with their chest exposed. Why were they so obsessed with just the flesh? It was nothing more than a chunk of meat stuck in a butcher’s shop.

Of the five officers seated at the table, Leon was the only one who felt that this was boring.

Unable to bear the boredom, he glanced lightly at Lieutenant Colonel Humphrey, who was sitting next to him.

The superior was smacking his red lips, not knowing that the cigar was turning to ashes. He had a serious expression like a doberman in Govurn, though the moment he left there, he started to laugh like a monkey.

It was not enough, he led the intelligence service officers to the cabaret for a farewell party for the commander who would soon return to civilian life.

A party without the main character

There was only one thing that was interesting to Leon, the contradiction. As he clenched his chin at an angle and slowly shook his bottomed glass, the lieutenant colonel tilted the whiskey bottle over him.

“Isn’t it fun?”

“It’s just that I’m picky with my taste.”

At his candid answer, the lieutenant colonel shook his head and laughed.

“Then, how about that girl?”

The lieutenant colonel pointed to the dancer standing in the center of the stage with the tip of the cigar. The girl who kissed the audience with her gorgeous smile was the most popular girl in Winsford’s entertainment district. It also meant that her night was the most expensive.

“Kitty Hayes. She is a woman no one can afford.”

The middle-aged man placed his arm around Leon’s shoulder and whispered, giving him valuable information.

“Hey, you are lucky today. This cabaret owner owes me something.”

Didn’t he once him Leon to be careful with women? Leon took a sip of his whiskey and twisted the corners of his lips.

“Thank you, but I don’t like it. I will decline.”

“Look, once you roll around dirty, it’s supposed to get better. That’s how everyone starts, isn’t it, Johnson?”

Major Johnson, who sat across from Leon, shrugged his shoulders.

“You are right, lieutenant colonel. However, it wouldn’t be bad to get married without knowing the fun like this. Won’t it be a problem if he falls into it late and loses his mind?”

The major winked slightly at Leon.

It had always been his job to stop the lieutenant colonel from pushing Leon, who didn’t like it every time he came to the cabaret, into a hotel room. Even though the major had a higher military rank than Leon, he had a lower social rank than the great landowners of Camden, including Winsford.

“Ah right. That noble Grand Lady. How is it? Is she your taste?”

“I don’t like getting married.”

The lieutenant colonel burst into laughter.

“It is.”

The lieutenant colonel, who was stroking Leon’s back with a thick hand as if he had said the right thing, muttered softly.

“But keep this in mind.”

“.”

“A hot night doesn’t always end badly.”

Leon just smiled bitterly.

The lieutenant colonel knew that he was reluctant to meet a stranger for fear that he would face a disastrous end like his father. He continued to point to the dancers on stage one by one, annoying Leon.

A woman approached this way with a luxurious black tray with a string tied around her neck. She was called by Lieutenant Campbell’s hand gesture, who was sitting next to him.

Leon stared quietly at the woman as Campbell paid for a pack of cigarettes and a few gums from her tray. She was a poor woman selling cigarettes.

She was no less than that maid.

Soon, a slanted smile was carved on his face.

Chapter 18
A woman who wouldn’t lose her innocence even when she wore a lewd uniform that exposed her breasts and thighs

Selling a forced smile to men no different from the prostitutes on stage, though with no intention of seducing the men No, she didn’t know how to seduce or anything like that. A peasant fresh from the countryside who didn’t even smell of perfume, let alone makeup.

Like Sally Bristol.

Even the eyes that were tired of the pleasure that displayed in front of her resembled Sally’s eyes looking at him.

Leon approached the woman who was standing against the wall. The woman who noticed his presence looked up at him with her deep blue eyes wide open.

“Wha, what do you need?”

He couldn’t figure out why she was stuttering. Was she depressed, or did she read the impure look from him?

He then picked up a box of candy from the tray, put it in the pocket of his officer’s uniform, and held out a bill. When the woman tried to give him the change, Leon asked, shaking his head.

“Is this your first time?”

“Yes?”

The woman widened her eyes again.

“Whyare you asking such a thing?”

Seeing her acting like a frightened rat, it seemed like she had misunderstood what he meant by her first time.

“Is this your first time doing this?”

The woman’s face turned red as if she had misunderstood. The woman lowered her gaze and smiled sheepishly.

“How did you know?”

“Obvious.”

Closing her arms and glancing down, the woman glanced at him, acting like a frightened rat again.

“Doyou need anything more?”

That was what the maid often says.

This might work

“Do you have a lover?”

The woman raised her eyes and laid them down. She gazed into his eyes and answered in a low voice, like a rat’s squeak.

“Yes.”

At that moment, the smile that appeared on Leon’s straight face was more twisted than ever.

Faith and love couldn’t be firmly established in the swamp of poverty. Because it easily collapsed even in the breeze of a few pennies.

For less than half of what he had given the maid a few days ago, the woman betrayed her fiancé and followed him to the hotel. Leon opened the door and the woman crouched, clutching the hem of her short skirt.

“Are, are you really going to do it with me?”

When she asked with a flushed face, Leon just smirked.

‘Stupid woman What makes you so excited? It’s not going to happen what you expect.’

A young, wealthy, handsome man spent one night with her, a poor and unassuming woman, and fell in love Well, it seemed like she was mistaken that something like a plot in a third-rate romance novel would happen to her.

“Go in.”

When he gave the order, the woman flinched and went inside. She followed straight in, and an insidious aura began to emanate from Leon, who slammed the door roughly.

The woman realized her plight a little as she stood in front of the bed, and she was at a loss for what to do. Leon did not go to the woman but leaned against the wall opposite the bed.

“Take it off.”

He ordered, pulling loosely the tie knot that was holding his neck.

“I don’t have time.”

The woman, frozen in place, took off her old trench coat only after he tapped his wristwatch. Leon’s eyes as he watched the woman undo the ribbons and buttons of the cabaret uniform were the same as when he looked at the naked dancers on the stage.

“Take it all off. Oh, leave the stockings behind.”

Even though she climbed onto the bed with her bra and bloomers all removed and only cheap rayon stockings on, the man did not come.

The woman spying on him with her hands wrapped around her naked body didn’t know what to expect. Meanwhile, in the mind of that young officer who looked like a movie star, another woman was taking her clothes off

Was it because it didn’t smell like blood?

Leon stared at the woman who was sitting on the bed, her skin exposed like a piece of meat, before reaching out to the small table.

“Gasp!”

As the sharp tip of the wine opener mercilessly dug into his thumb, the woman made a harsh sound. Leon, who started bleeding from his thumb, never twisted his eyebrows. He made his way to the bed, licking his tongue out of the blood that was about to run down his palm and wrist.

The woman retreated to the corner of the bed, her deep blue eyes shaking.

Gripping the woman’s chin as she was trying to run away from him, he squashed his thumb against her pale, quivering lips. The woman’s lips were all red with his blood.

‘This might work.’

His taste may not be the maid Only the smell of blood and the contempt in a woman’s eyes could excite him.

‘Yeah, despise me like that. So far, you’re doing very well.’

Leon, who gave a confident smile to the woman who glanced at him like he was a monster, bowed his head. The bloody smell on her lips moved closer at once.

The smell of blood.

And, a woman who despised him.

This would work.

It had to work.

“Oh uh”

It had to work

He stopped unknowingly just before their lips touched. Frozen for quite some time in the pose he was about to kiss, the woman called him in a trembling voice. Eventually, Leon pushed her chin and stood up.

“Get out, now.”

 


 
She was thinking of borrowing only Winston’s shower booth. However, when she came to her senses, Sally was already getting hot water in the bathtub.

That wasn’t enough, she lathered up a lot of fresh lemon-scented soap and took out a candle from the corner of the bathroom closet that Winston had never touched and left it lit. It was a pretty extravagant night for a poor maid and for the spy who was always desperate for money.

But, Sally was also human, so there were times when she was thirsty for this luxury.

‘A glass of champagne is perfect.’

She could go to the parlor and secretly bring a drink, but not when she had already taken off her clothes and was soaking in the bathtub? Next time she ‘borrowed’ the bathroom, she must not forget it.

There was no bathtub in her ‘home.’ In fact, it was not a house, although a room attached to a boarding house.

Originally, a family of four lived in a fairly large house. Nonetheless, after her father passed away, she received glares from those around her that it was big enough for the three of them to live. Then, when her mother died and her brother left, Sally had to give her childhood home to the other family and move to the boarding house.

Even though she was saddened, the house was the property of the community.

“The leadership should set an example.”

The words that Jimmy always chanted like a spell were a little comforting.

“You can use our bathtub anytime. We’re like family.”

Jimmy’s house had a bathtub with hot water. It was quite the offer, but she had never used it before because his smile showed his witty intentions.

‘Before the first night of marriage, it is not too early.’

Sally dipped her body down to her chin and let out a pleasant moan. She felt as if her muscles had been loosened from the hard work.

‘Let’s enjoy a little more and go out.’

As she closed her eyes in the dim bathroom and entered the hot water, she soon felt sleepy. Without realizing it, Sally dozed off and shoved her nose into the foam. Astonished, she lifted her head and blew the bubbles, and small soap bubbles floated up and down.

‘Now, I think I should wash my body before the water cools down.’

She paused as she inadvertently tried to pick up the sponge from the golden tray hung at the end of the bathtub — that was what Winston rubbed on his body.

“Uwak!”

Without realizing it, she imagined that sponge rubbing the cigar. Sally shrieked and dunked her head into the foam.

Please, let the bubble wash away all the dirty memories from her head.

“Foo”

Only when she couldn’t hold her breath did she lift her head out of the water. She took a deep breath as she wiped the water and foam flowing down her face with her hand, and she stiffened the moment she opened her closed eyes.

“Who have we here? Miss Sally Bristol more stuck up than Grand Lady Aldrich and more expensive than Kitty Hayes, in my bathtub, naked.”

Winston was smiling, leaning at the door across from the bathtub. His hands unbuttoned the officer’s jacket one by one.

‘Damn it. No way When did he come in?’

She didn’t wonder ‘how.’ It was because Winston had the master key of the annex. In other words, it meant that there was no locked door in this annex.

“Is it my birthday today? Or, did Christmas come eight months earlier?”

He took off his jacket and took two steps towards her.

“I’m so sorry, Captain.”

Saying so, she quickly wrapped one arm around her chest and leaned her body at the feet of the bathtub. Just as she was about to pick up her clothes from the towel rack, Winston hung his jacket over it and covered her clothes.

Sally raised her eyes and looked up at him. As he approached her nose, the filthy smile on his face became clearer.

“Captain, what are you doing now?”

Knowing it was a stupid question, she couldn’t help but ask. Winston quickly untied his black tie and threw it into the laundry basket, unbuttoning his shirt, and answered indifferently.

“Going into my bathtub.”

“Can you go out for a moment before that?”

“This is my bathroom, shouldn’t you go out?”

“Yes, I will go. Captain, if you could give me my clothes”

For some reason, Winston meekly put his hand under his jacket and pulled out Sally’s clothes.

“Thank y”

Her hand, reaching out to receive her clothes, stopped in mid-air.

Chapter 19
The only thing Winston politely offered Sally was the pair of stockings.

‘Alright, what was this maniac doing?’

“Go on, get dressed.”

Saying so, he grinned as if wishing for a compliment while wiggling the thin stockings playfully in front of Sally’s eyes.

“Or, shall I clothe you, noble Miss Bristol?”

“Captain, please. I’m really sorry.”

As she begged, he grinned and hung the stockings over his jacket. Sally pulled her knees up and wrapped them around herself, curling her body even further.

Even though she was in the hot water, her hands and feet were frozen. It was due to the helplessness. It was the worst situation. She couldn’t run away because she was naked. Besides, it was fatal to have a fight naked. She had to fight while revealing the vital points of her body.

Sally felt like a fish in Winston’s tank. How stupid it was that she jumped into the tank herself? He would take her out in one breath, put her on a chopping board, and greedily devour her

“Captain, please let me go. I will never use the bathroom again.”

“Hmm.”

Winston replied with a smile only on his lips. His eyes were that of a lion with mouth-watering prey in front of him.

“Can you tell me in advance instead? I’ll come in early.”

He unbuttoned his shirt and pulled off the cuffs of his sleeves until the prominent curves of his chest were visible. The sleeves were slowly rolled up below the elbow, revealing the smooth forearm. Dark shadows tinted vertically due to his clearly split muscles.

His muscles were not the only ones solid there. As she glanced at the exposed body, the fear that she might have to fight with a strong man with her bare hands came closer.

Sally recalled in her head the various self-defense techniques she had learned and used.

Let’s just avoid the worst. But, what was worse: being forced to sleep with that person or using her self-defense skills too well to be discovered as a spy?

“I can give you a special wash. That’s doable for Miss Bristol, who is struggling for me.”

‘I am suffering because of you, not for you.’

Sally bit her lip as she wept. It was getting worse and worse.

Normally, Winston would be light-hearted and sarcastic when something offended him, though now, his light actions and words were not sarcastic at all. He was really rejoicing like a child who received his Christmas present eight months early. That meant that no such thing like a desperate apology would work.

Moreover, unlike Winston’s upper body, as he leisurely rolled up his opposite sleeve, his lower body seemed impatient because the front of the pants was already rising like it was about to rip.

‘That bastard rutting all the time’

“Gasp!”

After folding his sleeves, his hand turned to the black leather belt.

“Please, don’t take it off!”

“Do you want me to come in dressed?”

He tilted his head at Sally as if she was saying something bizarre.

“You’re naked, but if I am clothed, it’s a big disrespect.”

His hand unbuckled the belt buckle and unbuttoned his pants at once. That bastard was really thinking of going into the bathtub.

“Kyaaak!”

As he grabbed his pants and underwear and pulled them down, Sally squeezed her eyes shut and screamed.

When the sound of his footsteps drew closer together with the sound of laughter, she crouched closer to her body as she felt a movement right next to the bathtub. There was a dull sound of something heavy falling on the rug next to the bathtub. At the same time, there was a loud jingle of the belt buckle.

He really took his clothes off. What if he got into the bathtub? Even though Sally knew it was not the time to cover her eyes, she didn’t want to open her eyes to see that person’s naked body.

Burying her face between her knees and curled up when the finger touched her earlobe, she shook her head in amazement. And then, another smirk passed through her ears.

“I didn’t take it off. Open your eyes.”

She slowly opened her eyes and glanced over to see that Winston was really dressed. Anger followed immediately after relief. He made fun of people by acting like he was about to attack. It was a really bad joke.

Still, anger soon gave way to embarrassment. Winston sat on the rug on the floor with one elbow resting in the bathtub. Sally’s face turned to contemplation as she belatedly remembered what was on the rug.

‘My underwear!’

Leaning her head out, she looked down at the rug, with her body still curled up.

‘Damn you, kinky bastard.’

Winston had the bloomer she had left on the rug in his opposite hand. He didn’t seem to have any intention of hiding the front of his pants.

“Ack!”

A finger that had been draped over the edge of the bathtub poked Sally’s cheek.

“Did you apply the medicine I gave you?”

Sally asked in a vigilant voice, dodging towards the wall.

“Captain, are you drunk?”

Again, the smell of strong alcohol wafted from him as he grinned.

“Don’t worry. I’m fine enough that I won’t do anything I’ll regret when I wake up tomorrow morning.”

Winston rested his elbows on the edge of the bathtub and pressed his chin on his raised knuckles. The wind blew as he brought his face closer. It felt like he was going to reach out and snatch her body at any moment. Even the blink of his eyes made her anxious.

“I just want to chat. We haven’t seen each other for a few days, haven’t we?”

Did he think that they were lovers who couldn’t live without seeing each other for even a day?

Sally thought she was only going to live without seeing him. And then, to chat with the naked woman stuck in the bathtub

It was a blatant lie.

“If you need a report, nothing happened during those days when you weren’t there.”

Although she suppressed her inner feelings, a cold wind blew from her voice. She must not show her hostility towards him. Sally always had to pretend that she was a compliant and good maid, but he was tenaciously testing her patience.

Sally cleared her throat and added kind words.

“So, don’t worry, Captain.”

“Really? Then, why did you go to Winsford a few days ago?”

“Yes?”

How did he know where she was a few days ago? Did he pass by? Perhaps, it was because of the gun that he had her followed? Still, no one followed her into the back alley on her way home.

“Did you see me?”

“Yes.”

“But, why are you asking that?”

“It was pretty annoying. I can’t concentrate on my work.”

“Why does that interfere with the Captain’s work? If you go to a big city when you feel cramped, it’ll be a change of pace.”

“With your fiancé.”

“Yes?”

“Is that change of pace like hanging out with your fiancé naked like you are now?”

“My fiancé is not in Winsford.”

“So, you’re rolling around outside Winsford?”

“.”

The maid stared straight at the man who insulted her. The woman’s place was as a lady in a rustic country. It got more appetizing when this woman didn’t know her place Like now, she had taken over her master’s bathtub as a maid.

“Then, where is your fiancé?”

Sally stared at Winston calmly.

Winsford and fiancé. Why was he fussing over things that have nothing to do with him?

Jimmy thought Winston saw her as a woman, although Sally thinks differently To that person, he just used his handkerchief to masturbate, that was all.

So, were those leading questions?

“Are you going to call the police for that gun?”

“Then, are you going to do everything to save your fiancé?”

“No.”

Leon couldn’t hold back the laughter when the maid refused words as soon as he finished speaking. He didn’t mean to, but he didn’t think he would be able to threaten her and make her spread her legs.

“You say you’re engaged? It looks like he was going to be punished, so you’re just going to leave it alone?”

“I have to take care of myself.”

Of course, these sarcastic remarks could not have been Sally’s sincerity.

Wasn’t Jimmy her lifelong comrade? Whatever danger he faced, she would not give up until the end and would save him. So, this was just a way to avoid uncomfortable topics.

“Oh, I see.”

Did it work?

Winston laughed to himself, and he reached for his jacket. He was rummaging through his clothes and found a small box in his hand before taking out a red candy from the box and held it to Sally’s lips.

“I bought it with you in mind.”

Surprised, he shoved the candy between her lips, who had unknowingly opened her mouth. Sally wrinkled her brow as she reflexively rolled the lump over her tongue.

‘I think he’s drunk’

To buy a candy thinking of her, which was something lovers would say to each other.

Leon stared intently at the woman who sucked candy while puffing one of her cheeks, not knowing the creepy truth behind those words. If he put his penis in that tiny mouth and pushed, would her cheeks puff out like that?

Chapter 20
Suck.

There was a strange sound as she rolled the candy with her tongue in her mouth and sucked it. At that moment, a moan like a sigh escaped Leon’s mouth. He took his hand, which was holding the woman’s underwear, to his center. It had already swelled up so much that it was aching.

It didn’t stand up to the naked woman selling cigarettes a while ago. This maid made his body aroused like a male in heat by her mundane act of only eating candy.

Leon haphazardly tossed the candy box on the rug and put his arm into the bathtub.

The woman rolled her eyes, puffing her cheeks like a squirrel biting an acorn. He couldn’t even reach her, but she flinched as if she had been electrocuted, evading further into the corner.

“Do you like hot things?”

Was this how hot the woman was inside? He would be happy to soak himself in, even if his skin would be all scorched and peeling off.

“Do you remember what I showed you a few days ago?”

He asked, stirring his hand slowly by the side of the maid’s chest. When the foam burst, the woman who had collected the foam from the other side and covered her exposed skin was startled. She had eyes that were as terrible as that day.

Leon, who had succeeded in embedding his private part into the woman’s head, slowly moved his hand holding her underwear with a bright smile.

“It’s hot, too, aren’t you interested?”

The woman shook her head as she glared at him while crouching down. He then raised the corners of his lips at an angle and pulled the strands of the dark brown hair, which had stuck like water weeds, on the maid’s shoulder.

Her wet hair was clinging to his hand Would her inner flesh stick like this?

He rubbed the spot where her secret place would have touched on the inside of her underwear. A faint moisture was felt from the seam, gently irritating the periphery.

It was obviously moisture that had leaked out of the woman’s body.

He stared straight into her turquoise eyes, which were shrouded in contempt, and quietly swallowed the moan that reached his chin.

When her shoulders shrank a little more as she watched his neck twitch, Leon’s eyes caressed her round shoulders, then scanned her straight and prominent collarbone. As he was about to go further down, a white bubble blocked his gaze.

He swallowed.

Her two knees, which rose in the middle of the whipped cream-like foam, were dyed pink like a delicious peach, perhaps because of the hot water.

Leon drew the naked body submerged in the water by connecting the pieces exposed out of the water as if completing a single painting by connecting numerous dots. The whispers that were heavily engulfed in the stillness that was as tight as a bowstring pulled all the way to the end broke.

“I wonder what it tastes like.”

Sally exhaled the breath she had been holding back.

‘Did he buy it without knowing the taste?’

She answered, swallowing the saliva that had just pooled in her mouth and rolling the candy to the other cheek.

“It tastes like cherry.”

Winston let go of the hair he was holding around his fingers and picked up the box of candy. He wanted to try one, too, though it wasn’t that simple. The box tipped over the bathtub, and red candy spilled all over the water.

What kind of trick was this?

Sally’s eyes widened open, and she opened her mouth like a fool.

“This I wanted to taste it as well, but my hand slipped?”

He poured it out with his own hands in front of her proudly, saying that his hands slipped. This lunatic

“I’m sorry, but we should share it.”

It was a trick to get her to kiss him.

Winston’s broad chest floated above her body, casting a black shadow. It wasn’t enough, so he placed his big hands on the side of the bathtub, locking Sally between his arms. His face tilted to the right.

As his lips got closer, the gap between the man’s lips widened. Sally rubbed her legs against the walls of the tub. With her arms around her knees and covering her chest, she tilted her head to the side just before their lips touched.

“Ah!”

He didn’t stop or change direction. He lightly bit the nape of her defenseless neck, exposing his teeth like a wild beast.

Sally’s hand reflexively pushed Leon’s shoulder, soaking his shirt wet.

He already knew what cherry tasted like. What he was curious about was this woman’s taste. Leon, who had been gnawing the nape of the woman’s neck with his lips, moved his head once more as his mouth watered. He had already tasted the sweet blood, so he wanted to try something else.

He wanted to chew and eat her from the tip of that tiny nose to the little toes What did this woman’s saliva and tears taste like?

His lips crossed the line of her delicate chin. It was the moment when he approached her, biting her soft cheeks and biting her on the lip, the dazzling sweetness of cherry wrapped around Leon’s tongue in an instant.

She smiled low, rolling the small candy under her tongue.

“Captain, eat it all.”

The woman spat the candy into her hand just before their lips touched and put it in his mouth. She even did the daring thing of covering his mouth with that hand.

That meant both of the woman’s hands were holding him now. She was defenseless.

“Ack!”

Winston’s finger rolled a nipple that was submerged under the foam. Sally struggled in surprise, but he held her soft flesh cruelly and relentlessly, not letting it go.

“Ahhk, let it go! Please, let it go!”

After mobilizing her fingernails, he took his hand off her with difficulty.

Sally warned him in an angry voice as if it went all the way to the top of her head, “Don’t touch me. I made the mistake of using the Captain’s bathtub, although that doesn’t mean the Captain has the right to do what he wants.”

Leon laughed.

The woman curled up like a rabbit in his shadow, covering her chest with her arms. No matter how harshly she warned him, it was only naughty.

“Pink.”

He sat down on the rug and let out a single provocation.

“Yes?”

“Your nipples are pink.”

The woman’s face turned white and immediately turned red.

“You haven’t seen it and yet you’re pointing it out.”

The foam was so thick it wouldn’t make sense. Sally hugged her chest tighter and glanced at Winston. His gaze was fixed on her upper chest, which had become more prominent.

“Then, let’s check if I’m right?”

The hand that was on the edge of the bathtub fell into the water at once. Even though she flinched and avoided him, his hand went in the opposite direction.

Pop.

There was the sound of something being pulled from beneath the bubble. The sound of water rushing out of the bathtub instantly followed Sally’s hesitation. At the same time, his hand appeared out of the water and held the stopper of the bathtub.

“Or, will you admit it?”

When the water ran out, her naked body would be completely exposed.

“That’s right! So, please return it.”

Sally reached out for the stopper, but Winston quickly put his hand back and gave a skeptical smile.

“What is right?”

The water was already down to the middle of her chest, so there was no more time to delay.

“It’s pink.”

As she muttered, Winston grinned at her, who was biting her lip in contempt, before holding out the stop.

Tap.

Just as she was about to receive it, the stopper was thrown into the corner of the bathroom.

“I didn’t say I would give it back.”

Sally almost threw a swear word at him. There was no shame in the anger that rose to the top of her head in an instant. Now, she was starting to think it didn’t matter if he saw her naked or not.

“Captain.”

“Yes?”

Winston smiled softly. Anyone who didn’t know that the cat tossed and played with the mouse before catching the mouse would think that his smile was sweet indeed.

“What the hell do you want me to do?”

She asked without hiding her hostility.

“You want me to tell you honestly?”

“Yes.”

He grinned.

Although he had an ominous smile, Sally knew he wouldn’t let the usual words come out of his mouth, anyway.

Leon stretched out his hand towards the maid, who was staring fiercely at him. The curvature of her ribs and the concave waistline were slowly revealed above the surface of the bathtub.

“Soon”

The woman trembled and stared at him even more fiercely as he lightly brushed the back of his hand on the curve of her breast that protruded out of her hand that was holding her chest.

“The bathtub will be empty.”

There were now less than two spans of water left.

“Then, I will go in Will you run to the corner? No, will you get up and leave? Wouldn’t that be the case, because I’ll catch you and throw you on the floor? You’ll have to be careful not to hit your head. I don’t have a hobby with a fainted woman.”

He recited his cruel imagination without hesitation as if waiting for that question. The knuckles protruding from the smooth back of his hands scanned Sally’s naked body exposed out of the water.
Chapter 21.

Contrary to the harsh words, his hands were soft as if he were caressing his lover. The gap was disgusting enough to make her shudder.

“You’ll struggle and struggle, but you won’t get out of under me. It’s slippery because someone throws soap in the bathtub without thinking. Then, if you break your finger, it’d be a big deal… I guess I’ll have to bend your arms behind your back and hold on to it. It’s all for you. You know, right?”



“Then, I’ll grab your waist. I’m going to pull your ass up to me and shove the thing I showed you a few days ago in the tight hole.”

He didn’t smile anymore.

Even though Sally met his serious gaze with contempt, Winston only exhaled harshly, even more excited.

“…Then, you’ll know.”

The back of his hand, which went down the water surface to her side, caressed Sally’s hip.

“Is the inside of your stomach as hot as this water…?”

His hand slipped through the gap in her knee as she raised her knee up.

As he was about to touch her secret place, she kicked his hand with her foot. For some reason, he gently moved his hand away. Closing his eyes, Winston took a deep breath and said in a voice deeply immersed in suppressing his cruel desires.

“But, I’m doing my best to endure what I want to do… You are a good kid.”

Sally suppressed the laugh from bursting out.

This is called enduring…? Does she have to go through the dictionary and teach him the definition of ‘endure’?

“Can I be honest with you, Captain?”

Winston nodded his head, still closing his eyes. Sally bit her dry lip once seeing that before she uttered a few blunt words.

“I’m disappointed in the Captain.”

To be honest, she would not have been disappointed with him since, after all, she had no expectations. The only moment she was disappointed by the enemy was when the enemy did not live up to her expectations.

“I thought the Captain was a man who wouldn’t do such terrible things as attacking me.”

At least, this was true.

“Besides, you’re going to be engaged to the Grand Lady soon.”

The betrothal of Winston to the Grand Lady was now of the utmost importance. So, to tell him to get himself together, she mentioned the Grand Lady. However, he was only breathing heavily, as if he couldn’t hear properly.

“Though why are you doing this to me?”

He slowly lifted his eyelids and stared intently at Sally. The strange words slipped between his lips, parted as slowly as his eyelids.

“Are you curious?”

“Yes.”

“You answer it.”

“Yes…?”

“I’m curious, too.”

Then, Leon spoke of what had happened at the Winsford hotel a few hours earlier. He bought a woman with a similar vibe to her.

The contempt grew stronger in the maid’s eyes when she heard the story of his failure where he couldn’t get excited when he stripped her off and put blood on her lips. It was even harder to contain her raging urge.

“Ha… This shit annoys me as much as you. I wasn’t interested in the promiscuity of having sex, but every time I see you these days, I get interested and it bothers me.”



“So, you answer it.”



“Sally, why’s it standing there only to you alone?”

In Sally’s eyes, as she was about to ask him why he was asking her that, her anger began to boil beyond contempt. It was because Winston raised his hand, which had been outside the bathtub all the time, in front of her.

“Why did I…”

At the tip of his sharp, well-groomed fingers, there was the white bloomer she had taken off.

“…Only cum with you?”

Winston dropped the semen-drenched underwear onto her peach-colored lap. The body fluid that contained his scorching body temperature was sticky on her skin. Even though she was disgusted and wanted to put it away right away, she couldn’t.

Sally couldn’t take her eyes off the man, who stood up slowly.

Contrary to what she expected that she would be attacked by now, he neatly adjusted his outfit and walked towards the door.

“This is my intuition…”

Winston suddenly turned his body and gazed down at Sally as she stared at him with a sharp gaze towards the part of his shirt that was so stiff that it looked like it was about to burst.

“I think you know the answer.”

He was notorious for his animalistic instincts as well as his cruel methods of torture. And, the notoriety wasn’t wrong.

Because Sally knew the answer.

As she held her breath, Winston wrinkled his eyes at her.

“But, why aren’t you wearing the stockings I bought you?”

He ripped her cheap stockings and threw them in the trash before striding out of the door as if nothing had happened. Only when the door slammed shut did Sally eventually let out a paused breath and ruffled her wet hair.

‘I’d rather get fired right away.’

 


 
‘…This is torture.’

Sally sighed as she dusted the book off the bookshelf.

Torture was not just inflicting physical pain, it was also outright mental torture that Winston drove her to every day.

 

“I think you know the answer.”

 

She was going to get caught soon… And, if she got caught, it would be over.

When he found out her true identity, Winston wouldn’t have killed her beautifully because Sally knew the leadership inside well. He would use all kinds of heinous torture to squeeze out key information about the revolutionary army’s stronghold and leadership.

‘Then, I’m not the only one at risk.’

It was not the time to sit still and talked about her responsibility as a spy since Fred would fill her vacancy. Although it was still uncertain, was everyone not bound to grow through a daunting task…?

Then, she could say to the chief maid right now that she would quit and packed her stuff, but it wasn’t that simple. She should be fired, not quit. If she returned as it was, she would then receive criticism from the upper management.

Sally hated hearing Jimmy’s disappointment.

Pretending to be fired wouldn’t work because Fred or Peter might tell it. Consequently, if she pretended that she was trying the new mission to become Winston’s mistress, there would be nothing to say if she got fired.

After much deliberation, Sally’s ‘how to be fired’ was the first strategy that came to mind—

—To get the gossip about Winston and her to reach Madam Winston’s ears.

“Miss Bristol.”

And, it wouldn’t be that difficult.

Winston came up behind her, standing on the low ladder. He was so close that she could feel his breath on the back of her neck.

“It’s good.”

“What?”

Sally clenched her legs as his hand slid between her legs and ran across her calves.

“I bought it for you.”

His fingertips slid over the smooth silk stockings. Usually, it was natural for it to slide down but his hand slipped up instead.

Wearing the stockings he had bought was part of the ‘get fired’ plan. It was already expected that he would get his hands on it, though she couldn’t tolerate him putting his fingers past the band of the stockings and under the laces of her garter belt.

“What are you doing, Captain?”

“Body search for illegal possession of weapons.”

“Didn’t the Captain take the illegal weapon?”

“Really?”

“It’s in the desk drawer.”

“You know…? Though why not take it?”

“You said it was confiscated.”

“You’re smart.”

It was a voice that was deeply regretful to be said as a compliment. His hand, which was groping around her thighs as he was looking for her pistol, which was supposed to be there, soon fell apart.

“I guess your fiancé saved you again?”

“Looks like you were waiting for me to break the law again.”

Since she was trying to get fired anyway, Sally stopped playing the docile maid.

His breath brushed the nape of her neck.

“Sally, as someone who cares about you, I’ll give you one piece of advice. You better not marry such a bad guy.”

For the second most bad guy in the Kingdom, Winston, to say something like this… There was no such contradiction. However, she couldn’t even say it was completely wrong because it was difficult to call a man a good man when he was trying to make his fiancé into the enemy’s mistress.

“Sally.”

If she left here, she would never use the pseudonym ‘Sally’ again. At this point, Winston would call her so often that if she heard the name ‘Sally,’ his smirk would also come to mind and she might have a nervous breakdown.

“Why?”

“One thing…”

The moment he spoke, someone knocked on the office door.

“Come in.”

Winston ordered Sally to stay still. The door opened, but instead of footsteps coming in, only a hoarse voice could be heard.

“Uh… Captain, I will come back later.”

Without looking back, she knew that the owner of the voice was Lieutenant Campbell. He seemed a bit perplexed when he saw his superior having a secret time with the maid.

Sally finally got what she wanted, but unfortunately, the rumors wouldn’t spread to the mansion because the lieutenant was a soldier. She had to be caught by a mansion employee with a light mouth to spread the word.

“Is it urgent?”

“It’s not like that. However, we have new information regarding Jonathan Riddle Jr. and we wanted to report it.”

Chapter 22.

“Come in.”

Even though Winston got off her and headed for his desk, Sally couldn’t relax.

‘Any information about brother…? What happened? No, more than that, has he been keeping an eye on him all this time?’

Even if her brother had turned away, she knew that the military could not just leave him alone, who was once a promising young executive in the revolutionary army. She just didn’t know that Winston was in charge of her brother.

If he was keeping an eye on her brother’s movements, it meant he was tracking her as well. As Sally pretended to do the cleaning, she anxiously listened to Campbell’s report.

“They say he received a large sum of money a few days ago.”

Sally’s mouth got dry.

“Who is the sender?”

“The name is Holly Easter…”

Winston smirked.

Holly Easter… He noticed at once that he had written the greetings to have a happy Easter as a pseudonym.

“What about the remittance?”

“From the post office on Main Street in Winsford…”

“Winsford?”

“Yes.”

“Impression of the sender.”

“All the information is that she had long brown hair, light skin tone, and was wearing round sunglasses.”

“Why is that all?”

His questioning voice was dangerously low.

“I’m sorry, Captain. I tried to interrogate the person in charge of the remittance but to no avail. It was not easy for them to remember. They were distracted because it was just before the store closed, and the person was dressed modestly, so there was nothing that left an impression on her.”

Sally turned her back and smiled at their conversation. This time, she was one step ahead again.

“A young woman in her early to mid-20s.”

“Yes, that’s right.”

“Little Riddle.”

Winston leaned back in his chair and burst out laughing.

“How so daring… How dare that rat come and go through my land like her own house.”

Hearing that, Sally struggled to contain her laughter at Winston’s angry voice. Truly, there was nothing more exhilarating for her to get to the enemy’s stronghold and slip from it.

‘He knows that? I am very bold, but you are pathetic.’

…Camden’s Vampire, what an overly generous nickname.

‘Pathetic son of a bitch.’

A pathetic bastard who didn’t even know that the rat he was chasing was in front of him. A pathetic loser who was at a loss of what to do because her body was too sweet.

“Sally.”

When Leon picked up the empty sparkling water bottle and put it down, the maid came swiftly to him and left with the empty bottle.

As he pulled the tie knot roughly downward, the perfectly symmetrical knot twisted a bit. He took a deep breath and rummaged through the inside of his jacket. Soon, a hazy smoke rose from his fingertips.

“I mean, she probably didn’t stop at Winsford just because she was bored on the way.”

“I think so, too. Maybe she was targeting the Western Command…”

“That would not be right. She will not be sloppy enough to send money in front of a strategic location, knowing she was going to be tracked down.”

So, what about that area…? There were not many places for the rebels to target in the Camden area. It meant that his home, the Winston Mansion, was not likely to be an operational site.

“Do you know the soldiers’ movements?”

“Yes, we have already started. First of all, we are investigating whether there are any suspicious activities or records of contact with each other, mainly before and after the attack.”

“If there is any suspicious person, report it immediately.”

“Yes.”

Leon blew out a long white smoke and lightly brushed the ashes from the end of the cigar. He wished he could shake off his doubts as lightly as this.

…That filthy rat.

Where was she hiding, spatting out suspicions as tough as chewed gum at him?

To prevent the worst, the investigation range may need to expand from his subordinates to the mansion’s employees. The good news was that he only needed to investigate women with brown hair. What he was unhappy about was the fact that brown hair was common.

He stared at the edge of the desk, contemplating, when the maid returned. His gaze turned to the woman who turned over the clean cup on his desk and poured the sparkling water, and Leon sharpened his gaze for an instant.

Brown hair… Winsford a few days ago.

The maid tilted her head as she held out the cup, feeling his gaze.

At that moment, his eyes darkened.

‘…What absurd speculation.’

This woman was not smart enough to do such a thing because she was a woman who worked every day getting played in his hands. As she slowly began to get on his nerves, he had already called the maid chief to inquire about Sally’s identity, but nothing was suspicious.

She also didn’t look like a member of the Riddle family, who was known for their impressive appearance. They were all blonde and had brown or hazel eyes. It was clear that the rat’s hair was a disguise.

“Good work. Get out.”

As Campbell left, Leon stood up, squeezing out the half of the cigar into the ashtray. He walked over to the sofa and turned around to see the maid tidying up the cushions in the corner.

“Ack, Captain!”

Leon sat down on the sofa and pulled the maid by the waist. Placing her on his lap and making her lean back as if he was holding a baby, the woman pushed him on the chest.

“Stay still. I’m not going to do it here.”

Then, that meant he would do it somewhere else.

Sally wrinkled her face to show her displeasure, though Winston didn’t even sneer at her. He reached under the white frilled headband and ruffled her hair. Her annoyance surged as Winston ruffled her neatly braided hair out of the blue.

“What are you doing now…”

“It’s brown.”

“What?”

“It’s real.”

Was he checking it because of the sender’s impression…?

“…So, did you think that I’m old enough to have to dye my hair?”

She deliberately pouted her lips. Sally didn’t consider herself a beauty, but it seemed that at least being beautiful had an effect. She succeeded in clouding Winston’s thinking.

“Don’t.”

Sally covered her lips with her hand as he approached her for a kiss.

“Uhh…”

When his wet tongue licked her palm, she lifted her hand, horrified. Winston asked with a mischievous laugh.

“Why? Have you never kissed?”

“…I did.”

The smile disappeared from his face.

“Haa… But, I don’t like it. Wouldn’t it be an honor for you to kiss a handsome man you’d only see in a movie?”

“It’s a disaster for those who don’t want it.”

Sally met his eyes and answered coldly as she grabbed his thick shoulder. As soon as she got up from her torso that had been half-lying, Winston pressed her shoulder again and laid her down.

“I have to finish the story I was talking about in front of the bookshelf.”

“Is it necessary to tell the story in this position?”

“Should I put you under me, then?”

Sally let out a long sigh.

“What do you want to talk about?”

Leon stroked her cheek with the knuckle of his hand as if caressing a lover before letting out a blunt word.

“You’re annoying me.”

“We already know that, Captain.”

“A few months ago, just looking at you gave me a strange feeling, but these days, it’s even worse. You keep messing me around, and it’s hard to concentrate on work.”

“Then, I’ll hide like someone who doesn’t exist. Or get fired…”

“It doesn’t have to be like that.”

“Well, what do you want?”

“Your body.”

Such blatant and rude words were no longer surprising to her. Sally responded without raising an eyebrow.

“It looks like the beginning and the end doesn’t match.”

“I’m going to try it once and put it away. It will be more boring than you think to roll around promiscuously. If I’m no longer interested in you, you’re comfortable.”

“I don’t want that.”

“Why? Do you want to be a mistress?”

“No.”

Leon couldn’t hold back his dismayed laughter when her decisive rejection fell before he could even finish his words.

“Yes, I don’t want to have such an annoying pet either. Besides, I’m telling you in case you might be mistaken, though I don’t even like you. I’m just doing this because I won’t stand unless it’s you. Do you know how annoying that is?”

“I know that, although I don’t like disgusting things like that.”

“How do you know if you haven’t tried it? Wouldn’t it be nice to actually try it?”

“Isn’t that more difficult then? The Captain got bored after trying it once, but what if I want to do more?”

It would never happen, but if she thought it would work, Sally had to say something.

“And, how do you trust me? If we have an illegitimate child, the Captain will be in trouble.”

“Then, it’s like a jackpot for you.”

“My dream is to live a normal and quiet life.”

“I’m just going to do it once so you can live quietly.”

“What if you don’t get tired of doing it once? You might get even more annoyed.”

A groan escaped from Winston’s twisted lips.

“You’re full of confidence, are you?”

“If you want to get bored with me, I can give you a boring date.”

Chapter 23.
A maid dating her master in front of others — there was no faster way to get herself fired. Besides, since she was in front of others, she wouldn’t have to worry about being accidentally hit by Winston.

“Isn’t that boring just hearing about it?”

“Right?”

As she smiled confidently, curling the corners of her eyebrows, Winston suddenly let out a laugh of absurdity.

“It’s probably going to be insanely boring. How about taking this opportunity to practice patience?”

“Practice… Am I a dog?”

“You are a soldier. Don’t soldiers have patience as their ability?”

For some reason, she decided to put his military qualities in the forefront and scratched his pride. Did it work…?

Winston licked his lower lip, deep in thought.

“If it’s a boring date…. There is one place that is just right.”

Then, he grabbed Sally’s waist and lifted her up without warning. He even pushed her towards the door.

“I’ll give you five minutes. Go change your clothes.”

 


 
As the front door of the mansion opened, the sedan moved slowly. When the car drove through the garden, she stuck close to the window to catch the eye of the employees, but luckily no one ran into them.

Sally stared tenaciously at her last hope, the gatekeeper.

The middle-aged man stared at her in the passenger seat and raised his eyebrows, though immediately turned away. At that, her shoulders slumped down. The gatekeeper was not a talkative person so he wouldn’t go out of his way to say that Winston was going somewhere with a maid.

“You tried hard.”

“What…?”

The maid turned her head and glanced at him. Instead of answering, Leon twisted his lips at an angle and smiled.

…A pale pink blouse with rustic frills, a brown plaid skirt, and a red cardigan with fluff. It was worse than when she was standing in front of the Winsford department store.

She was deliberately trying her best to make the date boring.

‘If that’s the case, take off your stockings.’

It was a sight to behold.

Through the thin black silk, the woman’s well-toned skin shone through. Besides, that rustic blouse didn’t have a tight neckline like a maid’s uniform, so her exposed clavicle and the concave groove beyond it kept attracting his attention.

His attention was focused on the edge of his field of vision even when he was looking ahead.

Leon couldn’t help but remember that woman crouching naked in the dark bathroom last night. No wonder there was another annoying reaction between his legs.

“So, what is the answer?”

“What?”

“You should know the answer.”

He was asking why he only felt lust towards her.

“I don’t know what you mean.”

Sally pulled her chin off her cheeks resolutely, glancing at Winston’s hand as he grabbed the steering wheel. She hadn’t seen him drive on his own in over a year, and she didn’t know what changed it today.

‘…It’s ominous.’

As usual, she thought the attendant and driver would follow. That meant that there would already be two witnesses in the mansion. Although she thought that, her expectations were shattered mercilessly.

‘Is he going to take me to a secluded place like this?’

Sally sat straight like a man wrapped in iron armor all over her body, staring straight ahead.

“Where are we going?”

“Winsford Marina.”

“…Yes?”

The sun was slowly setting. She thought about having dinner in Halewood or downtown Winsford…

‘Why the marina?’

As she turned her head to look at Winston, he was only looking straight ahead. When he wrinkled his eyebrows, she followed his gaze to see Peter’s postal carriage moving slowly in front of them.

“Sally.”

“Yes?”

“You and that guy seemed friendly last time.”

A short scream escaped Sally’s lips, who was about to deny she wasn’t.

It was because Winston suddenly shifted the gear and pressed the accelerator hard. The car sped up to hit the postal carriage. Sally exclaimed sharply as she got close enough to see the dirt on the rear wheel of the carriage.

“What are you doing now?”

At that moment, Winston steered the steering wheel roughly to the left and her body leaned towards the door.

Peter, who was looking at the car threateningly overtaking the carriage, was met with surprised eyes through the window. Her eyes widened even more as he recognized Sally. At least there was at least one witness that she had done her mission.

As soon as the carriage was overtaken, Winston steered the steering wheel to the right.

Her body staggered, this time leaning towards the driver’s seat. Winston laughed mischievously, seeing how fun it was for Sally to hold onto his arms so she wouldn’t fall.

“Wouldn’t it be better to leave the driving to the professional?”

Even though she was being sarcastic, instead of answering, he muttered something else.

“Is that guy your fiancée?”

“What?”

Sally wrinkled her face to the fullest, making it obvious that she was genuinely offended by that teasing. Seeing that, Winston only turned his eyes her way and raised the corners of his lips.

“I like handsome men.”

“Really?”

“Why does the Captain think that?”

“You don’t like me.”

…Superb.

Sally stared at Winston’s face with cold eyes.

Tanned skin just enough to look good, long eyelashes gracefully draped over the sharp eyes, a smooth falling nose, and a strong jawline…

‘Damn it.’

He was the devil she despised, but even Sally was forced to admit the fact that he was good-looking. Why was the inside so ugly, yet he had such a wonderful outer shell…?

“Oh, right.”

“What is it?”

“I can tell by seeing the Captain that I like handsome and kind men.”

Dispute the fact that she thought he would make a mockery out of her again, Winston wrinkled his brow and looked only in front. Was it rude to say that he was not nice? It was not that he got the nickname of vampire for nothing.

“Handsome and kind men…”

Leon bit his lip once, then squeezed out a light laugh.

“Then, it makes sense.”

 


 
‘What kind of trickery is this?’

Standing at the marina, Sally couldn’t keep her mouth shut.

In front of her, a luxury cruise ship with orange lights lit one by one. It was an overly grandiose place for a boring date.

“Go in.”

Winston shoved her back as if anchored to land. As she walked down the ramp leading to the entrance, she felt confined in a lavish prison, caught by Winston.

“Excuse me, Captain.”

“What?”

“When are we coming back?”

“Four hours later.”

Sally stopped in front of the entrance. Even now, she wanted to go out and have dinner in town, though Winston, who was quick-witted, would not let her go. As expected, she was pushed into the cruise ship, and just as she was settling her foot in the boat, he threw her an assignment.

“Try to make four hours feel like eight hours.”

The servant who was standing in the lobby immediately approached the two of them.

“Welcome to the Sunset Cruise that will make for a fantastic night out.”

…Fantastic, what was fantastic?

The moment his gaze met Sally, who was standing next to Winston with a displeased look, the servant raised his eyebrows slightly. He let out a slick welcome and even glanced her up and down. It seemed that he was surprised to see the shabby clothes that did not suit a luxury cruise ship.

‘What are you looking at like that? It’s just a uniform.’

She glanced at him, and the servant turned his gaze away and gave Winston an exaggerated smile, something they’d see on an advertisement poster.

“Where can I guide you?”

“The restaurant.”

When the answer felt like a command, the servant guided the two of them to the elevator. Passing passengers and employees, they all cast strange glances at her once in a while.

Though it was a little awkward because she was not used to receiving attention, it was a good thing. As long as the other people’s gazes kept chasing them, Winston couldn’t do anything nonsense.

As the elevator door opened, he beckoned her to go in first, as if she was his lady. He didn’t seem like a gentleman to push her back with his hand.

“It’s a good night.”

The elevator operator raised his hat slightly to greet him. Sally greeted him and stood on the corner. Then, she was followed by Winston, who was standing in the middle and rummaging through the pockets of his jacket.

The next moment, he took out two stiff bills and handed them to the operator. The operator’s eyes widened, and Winston nodded slightly for him to accept the money.

‘Is he tipping the operator every time he gets on the elevator?’

Frowning at the luxury, which she couldn’t even afford, Winston then grabbed her and pulled her into the middle of the elevator. As she stood next to him, Sally took a step away from him, and he grabbed her again. Finally, Winston cornered her against the wall and smiled.

It soon became clear what all these unconventional actions were actually for.

The door closed, and the elevator, which had been going up smoothly, suddenly stopped and rumbled loudly.

“Agh!”

Since she was holding her arms tightly and was in the middle of the elevator, Sally couldn’t lean against the wall. The moment she collapsed on Winston’s chest, her body staggered.

His thick forearms wrapped around her shoulders.

“Practice your patience, Miss Bristol. Are you trying to attack me in front of people?”

Chapter 24.
“Get away from me.”

She elbowed the man’s stomach to stop him from sticking close to her. Ugh, she thought it might have worked because he bent down with a sound, though Winston pulled Sally with the other arm and locked her in his arms.

“Shall we go straight to the room, honey? How about room service?”

A suppressed laughter erupted from the employees standing behind them as he played with his filthy tricks. Sally couldn’t see anything in her eyes. She poked the nose of Winston’s expensive shoe with her heel.

“Are you saying yes too exaggeratingly?”

When he let go of her with a laugh, Sally immediately got out of Winston and stood at the door.

The servant standing next to them glanced at the two of them and opened the elevator door. As she followed the servant down the hallway, Winston came close to her and whispered softly.

“You won’t break my toes if you step on it lightly like that.”

Although she stomped on him with all her might, it was regarded as light. Sally, whose pride as a soldier had been hurt, shot sharply.

“You know that you are lucky that my heel is dull.”

“My honey doesn’t have high heels? Shall I buy it for you on the way home tomorrow morning…?”

“Don’t call me that.”

“Is it embarrassing, darling?”

Saying so, Winston then grabbed the hand holding the strap of her handbag and dragged her. Sally grabbed her hand and pulled it out, sarcastically.

“You are the best torture expert in the kingdom, Captain.”

“Torture, huh…”

The smile finally disappeared from the man’s lips, who used to tease her with a low-key smile even if he was hit in the stomach or stepped on his foot.

“Sally… Since you don’t know, I’ll give you some advice. It’s polite to put your arms around a man in a place like this.”

He spat out the word ‘advice’ in a command line. The next moment, Winston grabbed her hand, still disobedient, and placed it on his own arm at will.

“For the lady, quiche with truffle and spinach as main…”

Sally, who had been silently watching him place an order for the waiter, interrupted, “No, I have changed my mind. Instead of that, I’ll have the Porterhouse Steak.”

The waiter looked at Sally in surprise. At the same time, Winston was equally astonished.

It was because the Porterhouse Steak with a T-shaped bone in the middle was a menu item that was not often ordered by people who were not big eaters because of its large amount. A woman who was conscious of others’ eyes almost never ordered a menu that was a symbol of gluttony.

Sally tilted her head and smiled. She was going to make his libido cool, even by putting herself to shame in front of others.

Even though he was a rutting dog in front of her, at least in front of others, he was Winston, the embodiment of manners and dignity. Does he have to spend four hours with a mannerless and dignityless woman in front of other people…?

She calculated that he would get tired of her at once and get away.

Winston narrowed his eyes to Sally and corrected the order spell with a small smile.

“Then, for the lady, Porterhouse Steak.”

As the waiter left, she began to brush the cardigan’s fluff. Winston scoffed again as he watched the scene silently.

“Miss Bristol.”

“Yes?”

“If I called you a lady, you should act like a lady.”

“What does it mean to act like a lady…?”

She sometimes had to infiltrate the upper classes, so during her training, she had to learn the manners and etiquettes of the upper class. However, Sally pretended not to know and took off her flair.

“Ladies don’t eat Porterhouse Steaks.”

“Is that so? That’s too much.”

“And, usually before you interrupt, shouldn’t you be sorry?”

“Did I? I’m sorry.”

Winston, unwilling to point out more, let out a short sigh of shock.

“One more. If you are a lady, you should avoid dessert.”

“Then, you should have brought a lady to this place.”

He gazed at Sally with an ambiguous look, not sure if he was smiling or upset, before opening his mouth again.

“Did you stop pretending to be a good maid in front of me now?”

“The Captain has stopped pretending to be a good master, too.”

Winston bit his lower lip hard. He was holding back laughter.

When the waiter brought wine, he took a large sip as soon as the glass was full. Meanwhile, Sally flipped over the fancy silverware and plates and pretended to check the label in a rustic way. Opposite her, people occasionally raised her eyes.

Crossing his legs, he scoffed again at the dirty nose of his shoe. Winston wiped the dirt off with a napkin and dropped it casually to the floor.

“What do you think? Do you like it?”

He asked, leaning back on his chair and placing his interlaced hands on his knees. Sally rolled her eyes and glanced around the restaurant, then nodded sarcastically.

“I understand why you brought me here.”

Winston tilted his head and raised his eyebrows, then immediately lowered them. He wanted to ask what she meant.

“It’s tacky.”

Leon couldn’t stop the sudden burst of laughter.

She dared to say that it was tacky when the most tacky thing in here was her. An intermittent laugh erupted from his mouth as he leaned his elbow on the armrest and rubbed his forehead with the knuckle of his index finger.

“I am having fun with you.”

If she had lied that she liked it like the Grand Lady, she would have become a boring woman in no time.

“You must make me sick. So far, it’s a failure.”

The woman ate up every piece of steak the size of her face.

Wasn’t it polite to have a conversation while savoring your meal slowly…?

However, the woman did not say a word and only ate the meat at a frightening pace. Halfway through, he pointed his chin out the window and said the sun was going down, and all she did was briefly reply, “Yes, it’s time for it.”

Watching the marvelous scene, Leon’s veal dish had already cooled down. When there was only a large T-bone on Sally’s plate, he put the knife and fork together next to the half-eaten dish.

“…You really ate it all.”

Then, they moved to the cafe. The woman who had been perusing the menu with a serious eye replied sarcastically.

“Did you think I couldn’t eat it?”

While drinks were in the back, the woman was looking at the front of the menu filled with cakes.

“You’ll eat… the cake too?”

Instead of answering, the woman asked Leon to order two cakes that she wanted to eat. Bewildered, he ordered the cake and coffee and stared at the woman who only glanced out of the dark window.

This date was going completely differently than he expected.

He naturally took the lead in any group from an early age. All situations were under his control. He expected it to be the case today, yet he had a strange feeling as if he was being swayed by that clumsy fox.

When the cake was served, the woman continued to eat without saying a word. Leon wanted to see how far she could fit into that tiny body, so he ordered another cake and asked.

“Don’t you go to Madame Benoa’s cafe every now and then?”

The woman then stopped the fork and raised her eyes to him.

“Yes.”

In the brief silence before answering, Leon sensed that she was confused to know that he had been watching her for quite some time.

“You eat everything well.”

The woman didn’t even do the courtesy to ask why he didn’t eat and took turns putting three cakes into her mouth, one at a time.

When the tip of her pink lips got the white cream, she poked out the tip of her tongue and even licked it. A mass of flesh a little darker than her lips glided over the dense folds. As her tongue vanished into her mouth, her lips wet with clear saliva opened again, and she snapped the bright red cherries.

…What a vulgar thing to do.

Leon crossed his legs towards the window and took a deep breath. Still, he couldn’t contain his urge.

“But, you won’t eat mine?”

The woman no longer showed any signs of displeasure. She even did the rude thing of shaking her head without even looking at the person speaking.

“Aren’t you afraid of getting fired now?”

Even that wasn’t enough, she ignored him.

“Miss Bristol, why don’t you try acting when you are cut off?”

“Hmm, me…?”

“You cried well in the office last time? Now that I see, I must have been fooled.”

The woman frowned as she poked her fork into the cake.

“It wasn’t acting. I was afraid of getting fired back then.”

The woman’s face soon returned expressionless. She didn’t show enough signals from her body to tell whether she was lying or not.

“But, now?”

“Right now, I feel like I have to make money with these insults.”

Leon’s face hardened coldly.

Insult. Him.

A promising military officer as a landowner… It was an insult to say that he, who lacked nothing from his lineage to his abilities, had no choice but to beg for something from a lowly maid. Leon wrinkled his brow as he thought so and put his hand inside his jacket.

He took out a cigar case and opened it roughly, chewing his words.

Chapter 25.
“Is it an insult to make a lady full?”

“You’re trying to make another stomach full.”

This woman, more and more…

Leon burst out laughing and closed the cigar case before putting it back inside his jacket.

She was a woman who smiled and asked, ‘When will we do the cleaning?’ even after witnessing the terrible torture and traces. He already knew that she had a bold personality. However, now, she had boldly put lewd remarks in her mouth.

“If a man falls for you, do you treat the poor person you fished as a disgrace?”

“I never tried to fish, so the poor person is me.”

She said she never tried to fish, and after eating the cake, the woman left immediately. She must have decided to drink up the most expensive champagne this time.

Getting drunk was usually a technique used by proud women to seduce a man and drag him to bed. Leon thought he would allow her to fish generously and ordered a bottle after the third cup, though the woman did not show any signs of intoxication.

“Aren’t you dizzy? How about lying down and resting?”

When he asked to go to the room, the woman did not respond and tilted the glass of champagne. Behind the woman’s head, outside the window, the marina, lit like broad daylight, was approaching.

It was already this late.

Leon sighed and rubbed his temples.

“Sally, I heard you said you’re going to make it boring?”

“Yes. You’ve been watching me eat for four hours.”

The woman wrinkled the back of her nose as if she felt sorry and added sarcastically.

“Silly.”

Leon smirked as he alternately cast his gaze between her close-knit legs and the face of the woman who was getting drunk and reddish.

“No, you know what I like too well for that. Are you born with it?”

The woman stared at him from the tip of the champagne glass on her lips. The eyes were saying, ‘why do you like me like this?’ Reading a bit of embarrassment, he smirked at an angle. Was this an opportunity to regain control?

“The clothes, I know that you purposely dressed in a rustic way… Though you made a mistake.”



“Light pink, red, brown. They are all my crazy favorite colors.”

The cold, pale pink that glints in the bathtub with her head buried in it. A fresh red color flowing through the split in the flesh, sticking onto brown dry, rough ropes…

All were the color of blood—The color of blood that excited him.

“You failed.”

&nbsp


 
The sedan passed the mansion’s front door and crossed the garden. The main building of the mansion, which was gradually approaching, was lit up brightly as if on a party day, even though it was not far past midnight.

“I’ve never had a date like this in my life.”

Winston rested his elbow on the side of the car window and rubbed his grinning lips. Meanwhile, Sally turned his eyes away and glanced at him sharply.

“Failed student, do it right.”

Even though she was called a failed student, she had nothing to say. It was because her plan to spread rumors failed miserably.

…No, was it too early to judge?

She had to pass the main building to get to the annex. As the car got close enough to clearly see the main gate, Sally exclaimed inside.

A luxury sedan stood on the stone road between the front door and the fountain. And beside it, Mrs. Winston was seeing off Grand Lady Aldrich… To run into two people at once who would be more wary of a woman who clung to Winston, the operation’s completion was right in front of her.

As the lights of the headlights and the sound of the engine drew closer, both women turned their heads in this direction. Sally made eye contact with them for a moment, then she lowered her head slightly and glanced at Winston like a sinner.

She had been found out, so she gave him a troubled look like what to do.

“Ah, the Grand Lady was supposed to come today. I forgot.”

Winston sighed briefly and parked his car behind the Grand Lady’s. She thought he was going to turn her car, though Sally followed Winston out of the car in astonishment.

As Mrs. Winstron’s eyes met hers, her face was also thickly covered with astonishment. There was also anger in her glaring eyes. At the same time, the Grand Lady never turned her eyes this way after the first eye contact. An awkward smile loomed on her calm face.

‘This should be enough.’

Sally, sorry that the innocent Grand Lady was in trouble, quietly opened the door of the car and came out. Without making a sound, she turned behind the car and tried to run away from the annex.

“Hey, what are you doing now?”

“Going in.”

Winston, who was greeting the two women, chased her and stopped her. He spoke calmly to his mother and his prospective fiancée before shoving Sally back into the car. That wasn’t enough, he leaned against the passenger seat door and locked her in.

Winston had done Sally’s plan himself, and that was too much.

He returned to the driver’s seat only after the Grand Lady’s car had left. Even though Mrs. Winston raised her voice in an angry voice, he didn’t say much and drove straight to the annex.

Sally glanced at Winston with a tired look.

She really wanted to open this person’s head. How the hell did his brain come to be? How could he be so proud even when his affair was found out…?

“Captain, I had a great time thanks to you, ack!”

As soon as they reached the annex, Winston grabbed Sally’s arm and dragged her as she was about to run into the maid’s room.

“Failed student, we should take time to discuss today’s failure.”

He grabbed her as if taking a criminal away and opened the door of the study on the first floor. The soldiers who were playing billiards inside froze as soon as they turned their heads in this direction.

“Everyone, get out.”

Although they all looked puzzled, they didn’t ask anything. Six soldiers rushed out at once and tried to close the door of the study.

Taking off her cardigan, she darted out of Winston’s hand. However, just before she escaped through the crack of the door, he slammed the door in front of her. A large hand gripped her hand as she grabbed the doorknob.

Sally raised her eyes and met Winston’s twisted smile.

“It is too late to discuss the failure.”

“The person who has failed her mission has no right to say that.”

His right hand opened up, and the red cardigan fell to the floor. His long fingers flicked up the convex buttons of her blouse one by one. The tip of his index finger began to roll the high peaks.

As she was staring at his hand movements, the nipples he rolled yesterday tingled uncontrollably.

Slap.

As soon as she slapped his hand, Winston leaned his head towards Sally. His arms were wrapped around her waist, and her body rose upward in an instant.

Instead of making a meaningless struggle on his shoulder, she checked the location of the military dagger and pistol tied around his waist. There was no point in resisting now. She had to use the right weapon at the right opportunity.

Sally’s turquoise eyes flashed as she glanced at the pool table passed in front of her. It was as if she had a blunt weapon spread out on the dark green cloth.

Winston walked to the other side of the door and laid her on the pool table. While Sally immediately got her body up and sat down, it was impossible for her to escape. It was because her lower body that hung over the ends was tucked in between his wide-open knees.

Sally calmed her pounding chest and stared at the strong man in front of her eyes.

…She could fight him today.

After all, Mrs. Winston would be kicking her out soon, so she shouldn’t worry about ruining her mission. All she had to do was fight, making sure it looked a little sloppy so it wouldn’t look like professionally trained in combat…

As long as she doesn’t kill him, that’s enough.

While Sally prepared to fight his vitals in her head, Winston only thought of smashing right into her.

“As you can see, you have completely failed.”

As he unbuckled the belt on his officer’s jacket and took off his clothes, it became clear what she was looking at. One button thread came loose because the front of the trousers, which had been hidden at the end of the jacket, could not come out as if it was about to burst.

Winston neatly folded the jacket in half, laid it neatly on the pool table, and started rolling up his sleeves. It was no different from the preparations he made whenever he personally went to torture.

“Your method failed, so now, I have to try mine.”

Meanwhile, Sally squinted at the holster over his jacket, estimating the distance. She might as well shoot him in the shoulder. Then, she wouldn’t be touched by Winston again until she was safely expelled.

He rolled up his opposite sleeve and scolded her for her failure.

“Even if you cry today, I won’t let you go.”

Winston leaned over towards Sally and placed his hands on her sides.

The space between their slightly gaped lips was mixed with breaths. The heat made both of them shiver like people on fire, but the meaning was different.

From a close distance where the tip of their noses almost touched, Winston spoke softly as if he was whispering while making eye contact.
