It was a night when we had to sing a song to commemorate the last day of the year. However, at the Witheridge detention center, only the chilling screams echoed through the corridors late into the night.

"I'm bored. So boring."


One of the officers sitting around the round table in the lounge on the first floor stood up and turned up the volume of the radio. Only when the singer's piercing voice drowned out the screams did the expressions of the four officers relax considerably.



Due to the sudden declaration of a state of emergency at the end of the year, all the officers on duty who could not return to their hometowns were affiliated with the Northern Command. Officers from the Western Command occupied the lounge on the basement first floor, where the investigation room was located.


These days, there has been a subtle tension between the two commands, causing an underlying discomfort among the officers as well.



The Northern Command was anxious about being criticized for not properly controlling its territory, as the rebel stronghold had been hidden in the north for decades. Meanwhile, the Western Command was not eager for active intervention in the north, wary of the possibility of losing credit.


It was a predictable story.


Before long, the song ended on the radio, and a current affairs discussion began.


[For the listeners across the country, there couldn’t be a more touching Christmas gift for the Rochester royal family.]




[Of course not.]
Everyone wore a forced smile. It was clearly evident that the king was coveting the attention focused on Captain Winston. Today was still Winston Praise Week, but starting tomorrow, the praise of the media would be shared between Winston and the king.



The granting of the title was not a foregone conclusion until just a moment ago, but the special promotion was already a foregone conclusion within the military.

"At such a young age, you've already earned the rank of major."


There are rumors that the Western Command requested Captain Winston's promotion by one rank, and that it was approved by Army Headquarters, even though the investigation has not yet concluded.

The eradication of the stronghold and the capture of the leader would be enough to warrant a special promotion.

So, there would have been no disagreement even from that difficult headquarters.


“By the way, to carry out the operation during Christmas week.”


It was the time when everyone took a vacation and went back to their hometowns. It could not have been an enormous inconvenience.



"When I first heard it, I thought they were out of their minds. Setting aside the complaints from the lower ranks, did they really allow that from above? It was unbelievable."

However, it turns out that everyone is taking vacation and going back to their hometowns during this week, so they initiated the sweep operation at this time.

"I already knew it was a village. I calculated that even the rebels who were out in the wild would all return because it was Christmas."



Thanks to that, we were able to capture the core figures of the rebels all at once, leaving only the small fry at the bottom of the power pyramid, who have no connection to the base.

"I heard that he was a scary person to begin with, but the more I get to know him, the scarier he becomes."


A soldier, who had placed his cards on the table while nodding his head, suddenly asked as if he had just remembered.



"So what happened to that double agent?"


I looked around at my colleagues, but everyone shrugged as if they didn’t know either.


“Since I contributed, maybe I wasn't punished?”



"By the way, how did they persuade them?"
Some people say things like a cliché ending of a popular novel, that revenge won't bring back the dead father, while others believe it is because it was revealed that Patrick Pullman, who has now been identified as an accomplice in the incident, has already passed away.



"The eye seal has failed again this time."


The captain walked forward without looking at those who saluted him and went straight underground.


Only Campbell, who was following him, kept sending glances.


"Do not speak to the captain."


Campbell gave a visual warning to the commissioned officers of the Northern Command and followed the captain down the stairs.



Captain Winston was experiencing the best of times and the worst of times. No, it might not be the best of times at all. He was only looking at one woman he missed despite capturing hundreds of enemies.

As a result, for the captain, this operation was a failure.


Campbell quietly observed the back of the captain, who boldly rounded the corner on the first basement level. Although he appeared stronger and more steadfast than anyone else, Campbell defined the captain differently based on what he had seen since their time at the military academy.


Nitroglycerin that explodes at the mere touch of a feather.


Since he started assisting the captain, it has been the most unstable situation. Therefore, he stayed more alert than usual and was particularly cautious with his words and actions.

As the security area with iron bars began to come into view, the soldiers standing guard in front promptly opened the iron gate before receiving instructions. They had experienced this several times, so they understood the captain's mood well.



Without pausing for a moment, the captain headed towards the room where the fallen rebel commander was imprisoned.



As the door opened, Blanchard, who was lying on the bed in the corner, turned his head this way. The moment his gaze met the captain’s, the color drained from the face of the man who had no uninjured part.

As the captain who entered inside sharply gestured towards the table in the center, the soldiers who had been on lookout ran over to Blanchard and helped him up.

"Ugh...."



The guy, who had no part of his body untouched just like his face, continued to groan even while sitting in a chair.
The soldier searching the village hall discovered an entrance leading underground beneath the round table in the conference room. Below, there was a bunker prepared for emergencies, and there was also a passage leading somewhere.



The reason we couldn't know where it led right away was that it had collapsed into a dead end.


The safe in the bunker had empty spaces here and there, indicating that someone had hurriedly stolen money and weapons. Clearing the passage revealed traces of dynamite explosions.

At a time when escaping the army is urgent, one must prevent a comrade's escape by detonating bombs.


It was clearly the woman's doing.


The woman's prediction was exactly on point. In the underground bunker, there were a few injured old leaders who had been caught in an explosion while trying to flee after pushing the young people into the battleground.

"This road leads to the riverside on the west side of the village. Grace Lee and the others must have fled that way."


They had already figured out who had destroyed the passage and revealed where it led before he could even ask.


No, it was more of a tattling than a confession.


It was easy to release the detection dog and track the woman. However, it became difficult when her scent was lost at the dock.



The upper reaches of the river connected to neighboring countries, while the lower reaches led to the sea. In other words, escape abroad was possible in one go.

In between, there were dozens of cities and towns, and using the railway from any point connects to thousands of places.



So theoretically, there was no place that woman couldn't go.


I had to narrow down the search area. However, to do that, I needed information such as the model name of the boat the woman was in or the capacity of the fuel tank, but Blanchard did not cooperate at all.

The only thing to rely on was the inaccurate information obtained from other prisoners.


"It was made of mahogany...."


No matter which dock you go to, half of the recreational boats were made of the most fashionable mahogany material these days. This was as useless as testifying that the strength was masculine.


Moreover, the fact that everyone couldn't remember the boat's name properly and gave different names caused
He shut his eyes tightly as if that scene came to mind.


"My point is that if you cooperate in finding that woman, I will ensure that you can avoid the death penalty."


He sighed deeply with his eyes closed. Perhaps he was calculating with his walnut-sized brain in his own way. As soon as he saw a slight sign of wavering, Leon added a comment in a rather generous tone.

"Even if it seems ridiculous to be a captain, I have that level of ability. So think carefully."


However, that idiot's brain, as small as a walnut, was so slow that Blanchard remained silent as nearly a third of the cigar burned away.



"If you don't want to live, I can ask the others. Do you know how your comrades behave? Just hearing the name Lee made them spill everything without even being asked."

Everyone was burning with a desire for revenge. Just as he intended.


Moreover, for those desperate to find their own way, the Grace Lee's were indeed a perfect opportunity to assist the military while not betraying their comrades.

The problem was that they were not that close to the woman.


They unnecessarily recited the woman's charges when they ran out of information. Their intention to drag that woman down to hell with them was obvious.

How much of the truth will actually be among them?


From forging official documents to infiltrating government agencies, and from bomb terror to assassination. Listening thoughtlessly, it seemed as though that woman alone had carried out dozens of 'revolutions.'

Their so-called 'active cooperation' only served to provoke his anger. He didn't care about what was stolen from the king's villa. What he wanted to know was solely the whereabouts of the woman.

At the end of the wait, Blanchard finally opened his eyes.


“Then let me tell you the only place I know.”


Was everything that has been obstructive up until now a strategy to raise my price? Did he decide to go along with the deal as he picked up a fountain pen?

Leon's face, staring intently at the tip of the fountain pen, suddenly hardened as he forgot to shake off the ash from his cigar. The large, scrawled letters in the middle of the map were neither someone's name nor an address.


Hell.
"Or are you really trying to insist that you still love that woman?"


“No, now I regret loving Grace.”


The moment he spat out a rude comment through his clenched teeth, Leon's patience finally burned to ashes.


Who do you think you are?


I loved Grace. Not anymore. And I regret it.


The same words echoed repeatedly in his empty mind. The bitterness spread into his mouth as the poem came to an end.



Arrogant brat, who do you think you are?


Leon placed the cigar on the edge of the table. As he began to take off the cuffs that secured the ends of his sleeves one by one and neatly placed them on the table, Blanchard's eyes, the same color as the cigar, started to tremble.



As I neatly folded up the sleeves on both sides, the cigar precariously perched on the edge dropped a thick ash to the floor. The color of that ash was the same as that guy's complexion.

"Jimmy...."


He rolled up his sleeves above the elbows and, putting on black leather gloves, picked up the cigar. Taking a long drag, the dying ember flickered back to life, and the tip of the cigar burned as red as the blood congealing on his hand.



"Have you ever kissed that woman?"


The moment I asked, twisting my eye corners painfully, I sensed a sharp vigilance in his gaze.


Honestly answering will reveal what will happen, even with a brain the size of a walnut. Until now, I had boldly kept my hands on the table, but now I've taken them away and adopted a defensive stance.

"...there isn't."


"Oh dear, who could be lying? I heard that woman has tried it."


Of course, she never said such a thing.


Just like when he guided the paper with a boat, he bit his lower lip again. It meant that he had kissed that woman.



With those lips, to that woman, no, to my woman.
“James Blanchard Jr.”


As he lifted his face to eye level, it turned pale in an instant. The guy tried to lower his hand, but before he could reach, he was grabbed by Campbell and his hands were tied behind his back.

“Do not mention that woman’s name on this foul mouth again. If you do it one more time, I will cut off your tongue.”


He raised his right hand in front of the guy's eyes and pretended to cut with scissors.


"Vertically."


Blanchard's eyes trembled. Leon twisted his mouth into a smile and tossed him aside like a throw.


He leisurely lowered his sleeves to fasten the cuffs. Blanchard stared at him with eyes filled with fear, looking no different from when he had come in with the jacket on. Leon, who was about to leave with a sneer, suddenly stopped.



"Oh, it's the last night of the year. I mustn't forget to say my goodbyes. Unlike you, I'm someone who knows manners."



Leon smiled with a twinkle in his eye and offered Blanchard words of encouragement.


“May next year be a more hopeful year than this year. For that futile hope may be all that's left for you.”


As soon as I stepped into the hallway, the smile vanished from Leon's face. From behind me, I could faintly hear Campbell's voice instructing the duty soldier to call for the doctor.

What is the reason to keep alive a useless little brat?


It was not a thought made without knowing the reason. Both the royal family and the military highly valued the achievement of capturing Blanchard alive. In order to eliminate the remaining factions and resolve the incidents that remained as unsolved mysteries, the information possessed by the author was necessary. In other words, the longer the author stayed alive, the more his contributions would grow in significance, thus becoming a great strength for both Leon personally and for his family.



However, now everything looked insignificant in his eyes.


As soon as that arrogant little rat is killed, if that woman returns, Leon will disregard all the interests of the company and kill the bastard without a moment's hesitation.

"Ha…."



Leon sat alone in the living room of the suite, letting out a weary sigh.
he could make a different choice.


In this cold winter, not only is the body unprepared, but the heart is also a mess. In such a state, where on earth could one be wandering?



The place you should be is over there.


As I raised my head, I saw the bedroom door wide open. The bed that should have been shared with her was empty, with the sheets perfectly smooth. In the end, I couldn't pop the champagne.

He closed his eyes again and let out a sigh that sounded like a groan as he got up. Picking up his officer's jacket and coat, he stepped out of the suite.

It was close to midnight.


On New Year's Eve, Leon parked his car in the quiet square of the ghost town and headed straight for a shabby three-story building in one corner.

As the soldiers on guard at the first floor of the boarding house saluted, Leon merely gave them a perfunctory nod and went up to the third floor.

I approached the only door marked with a "No Entry" sign and inserted the key I had taken from my coat pocket. As the door creaked open with a grim groan, the scene that unfolded was no different from yesterday.

A cramped boarding room. A single bed with only a mattress placed awkwardly. A wardrobe, a desk, and various miscellaneous items.



I entered and closed the door. The room was so damn small that just turning on the lamp on the desk made it bright. Just standing alone between the desk and the bed made the room feel cramped and suffocating. The room, which hadn't been ventilated for a long time, had a damp mildew smell.


The torture chamber is much more pleasant and spacious than the woman's room. It was still an astonishing thing.


I guessed that the woman was likely from a lifestyle of at least middle class, judging by her disdain for cold showers, her arbitrary use of the owner’s bathroom, and her picky behavior towards cherries.

Moreover, she was a member of the royal family that led the revolution. It didn't make sense to say she was treated this way just because she was a illegitimate child. That woman was even the fiancée of the leader before she was abandoned. So, shouldn't she have at least been treated like a princess?


"What kind of palace is this?"


I could hardly imagine living in such a backwoods place, especially in a boarding house with mold.



This doesn't make sense.
The moment I opened the old travel trunk that had been under the bed, time stood still.


No, perhaps time has gone back.


Leon carefully picked up the straw hat, surrounded by various objects, as if he were excavating an artifact.


Why on earth is this?


Why had I still kept the straw hat he had bought for me?


"I truly… liked you too."


Could it be that it's because of that? No, it doesn't make sense.


Leon, who had been denying it, suddenly recalled the dim memories of the old days when he graduated from the military academy and returned to the mansion.

"What should we do about this?"


While organizing his childhood belongings piled up in the storage room, the maid brought over a dolphin doll and asked. It was an item he hadn't even realized he had kept all this time.

At that time, it was nothing more than a catalyst for unpleasant memories for him. Yet instead of saying to throw it away, the words to put it back in the warehouse came out instead.

Why did we do that instead of completely forgetting?


Whip. Bang.


He looked down thoughtfully while holding a straw hat in his hand, and then he lifted his head at the sound of fireworks. Outside the window, colorful fireworks began to color the black sky in celebration of the new year.

Leon suddenly recalled another day symbolized by champagne, kisses, parties, and fireworks. It was the night of his engagement, the night that became the turning point leading him to this place.

Tang.


The woman who mistook the sound of fireworks for gunfire and turned pale with fear, and the self who watched that scene and laughed at her loomed before me.

His face, reflected in the window beyond that illusion, was disturbingly contorted without a trace of laughter. Leon gently closed his eyes.




The moment I decided to walk this path, I believed it so. If the woman had a child and the brainwashing was lifted,
2,678,400 seconds.


I knew it was a calculation that had no meaning and only added pain, yet I could not stop.


2,678,401 seconds. 2,678,402 seconds. 2,678,403 seconds….


"Ha...."


The sound of placing the fountain pen on the table with a sigh echoed harshly in the empty first-class cabin.


I considered every possibility, but I never anticipated that I would return alone. All those possibilities were thought out to prevent me from coming back without that woman.

However, she couldn't wait indefinitely in the place where the woman had disappeared, nor was there any reason to do so. Knowing that, she held out in the north under the pretext of prisoner interrogation and investigation, only leaving when the award ceremony was just around the corner.


The royal event schedule was typically planned without any gaps for at least six months. Yet, less than a month after announcing the conferment of titles in the New Year's address, the royal family informed that a ceremony would be held.



Recently, it was clear that they were using him to soothe negative public opinion towards the royal family.


At the end of last year, just before the operation, rumors circulated in the financial world that the true owner of the joint venture that had just obtained the mining rights for the Bria Diamond mine was the king, and eventually, it spread even to tabloids.



Of course, it was a rumor spread based on Leon's certainty that the woman would be by my side during this time, so the timing was just right.

The public opinion on the royal family's secret investment under a pseudonym was understandably poor. If they stepped forward to clarify that it was not true, the rumors in the shadows would become established facts in the light, so the royal family put forward an "anonymous royal source" to the press, dismissing it as mere rumors, while secretly engaging in the insidious act of manipulating public opinion behind the scenes.


Then, just in time, he drew everyone's attention by annihilating the rebels.


The king would have been grateful that Leon rescued him, not knowing he was his enemy who pushed him into the water.



Anyway, it was on the way back after spending a week in the royal capital because of that damn clown show. I couldn't remember anything about the award ceremony, the royal palace, or the look in the king's eyes when he saw him.



In a hall crowded with countless people, while a tedious meal was being served, he was lost in disorganized and ugly thoughts.

Leon couldn't take his eyes off the three letters. On the platform's pillar, a missing persons flyer was posted alongside a notice seeking information on the remnants of the Blanchard rebels.

In her mid to late 20s. Teal-colored eyes. A small dot under the left eye. Slim build. A pregnant woman expecting to give birth in May.



Flyers searching for women were posted on every pillar. It was only natural since they had spread them all over the kingdom.



On the street, personal missing persons flyers were posted like this, but at the checkpoints and ports in the border area, a wanted order was issued on the day of the disappearance in the name of the Army headquarters. She might be trying to go to her aunt overseas.



Probably quite soon.


Based on the testimony of the higher-ups, the woman estimated the amount taken from the safe. If she were to escape alone without any local connections or accomplices, the money would run out in a matter of months. Moreover, by late spring, that woman would need quite a substantial amount.


So, I issued a wanted notice to pawnshops, jewelers, and even to the fencing dealers.


Not a woman, but the wanted notice for the ring.


The woman, who failed to escape abroad, was planning to sell the ring he gave her to cover the cost of childbirth. Since she was heavily pregnant and couldn't go far, they believed that narrowing the encirclement around the area and thoroughly searching hospitals and midwifery centers would allow them to catch her.


He warned the woman in his mind while fixating on the word "turquoise eyes," which was neither a name nor a photograph in the flyer.



You know it will be caught in a few months anyway. Stop the unnecessary suffering. Tone down your stubbornness and come back quietly.



Perhaps I thought he might be hiding because he was afraid of the punishment he could impose. Should I have written a kind word on the flyer?

Normally, it would have been a moment for mockery, but Leon's face was simply stiff.


A month has passed, so the belly must have grown more, and the body must have become heavier. I vaguely remembered reading in a book that this is the time when it starts to become difficult due to the weight.

And it was also a time when he had already felt the stirrings and more.


A feeling of questioning gazes began to be felt. Leon took his eyes off the text-only flyer and walked into the train station. However, his thoughts still lingered on that insignificant piece of paper.

He still hasn't found the answer. Now, I don't know that woman.


In front of the train station, a white limousine was parked. It was clear that repainting the new car, which had been ordered in black just two months ago, in such a noticeable color was an idea stemming from my mother's vanity.

Moreover, what on earth was it that they decorated the car with ribbons and flags? It seemed they were under the illusion that they were holding a parade.

"You're doing something pointless."


Riding in an absurdly ridiculous limousine through the city of Winsford was a torment. The eyes of the crowd moving to and from the theater during the evening hours were focused on this side. As the carriage in front stopped by the roadside, the moment Leon's car passed by, the coachman tipped his hat in a gesture of respect.


Leon seized the cane from Jerome, who was sitting across from him. As he tapped the ivory- decorated tip against the window between the driver's seat and the back seat, the driver, who had been honking the horn boastfully a moment ago, looked back.



"Stop it."


As soon as it became quiet, Leon threw the cane back to his brother as if tossing it, and closed his eyes.


"Why does your expression look like that? Anyway, soldiers..."


One more reason why the journey by car was miserable was that while the train allowed my mother and me to ride in different cars under the pretext of work, we had no choice but to ride together in the car.

"Behave like a general."


Leon’s brow furrowed. The word "victory" means returning after winning a fight. He lost. Miserably. Therefore, the grand welcome felt like mockery.

“To become a general, there is still a long way to go.”


"Oh my. Don't say such ominous things, Jerome. Just imagining you wearing a uniform until your brother hears the call of a general is dreadful."

The mother sitting next to Leon, who still had his eyes closed in silence, called him.


"Leon, you've regained your title and avenged your father, that should be enough. Now, give up the military."


"You said we wouldn't bring that story up anymore."



"I'm saying this because I'm thinking of you."
Even while driving through the suburbs outside of Winsford, the slandering of my mother's aristocratic family continued.



“Now that I say this, it feels a bit strange, but in truth, the Grand Duchess was not very fond of it either. She hasn't made any effort to get close to the person who will be her husband, has she? Leon, has the Grand Duchess ever called you to check on you? As far as I know, she hasn't. I wonder if she lacks any friendly charm….”


Eventually, Jerome, unable to listen any longer, interrupted.


"On that point, my brother would be even more so. In fact, I don't think there's a bride who fits our family's status as well as you do."



Elizabeth glared at her sulking second son sitting across from her and shot back.


“Why do you side with the Grand Princess instead of your beloved brother?”


Well, what Jerome loves is not me but the grand duchess. Leon, who had been listening silently, quietly scoffed.


"Now the status of our family has changed, hasn't it? No, we've just regained our original status. Ah, no matter how I think about it, we rushed into this too quickly. We could have found a better match. Even if we were to form a marriage alliance with the Grand Duke's family, we could have done so under much more favorable conditions."


The two brothers looked out of the window, not responding to the words they had heard to boredom.


"It seems that even the Grand Duke is perceptive enough to know that the circumstances have changed now. Just last year, he wanted to postpone the wedding, but now he brazenly insists on rushing to set a date. So I decisively refused. Didn't I do well?"



As the Duke came up in conversation, Leon clenched his teeth once more. It was because he suddenly recalled what the Duke had said during the toast at the congratulatory party held after the conferral ceremony.

"I sincerely hope that Count Winston, having finally shaken off all the stains of the past, embarks on a fresh start as clean as the snow that fell last night."

The Duke knew that the woman had vanished. Not only did he show signs of being pleased by her disappearance, but he also treated the woman and her child like a filthy stain.

I had to resist the urge to pull out my gun and turn him into a beehive right then and there. That wasn't Leon's job.


Just wait and see. Someday. As soon as that woman returns.


"Your Excellency, congratulations."



As soon as the car stopped in front of the mansion's main building, the butler opened the door with a bright smile.
In the empty bedroom, what first caught his eye were the things the woman had left behind.


The slippers neatly placed at the foot of where she sleeps, the partially knitted wool hat, the ring box, the crystal bowl filled with chocolates, and even the penthouse catalog.

“Damn it….”


The next sense after hearing and sight was smell.


The familiar scent of the woman mixed with the citrus fragrance of the perfume he had bought for her and poured into Leon. At that moment, something seemed to clog the airways, making his chest feel tight.

He fled to the bathroom from my bedroom. Ignoring the traces of that woman who was once again attacking him even in the bathroom, he undressed and entered the shower booth.

As the sound of water pouring down like a torrential rain became faint, the pounding of his heart resonated loudly in his ears, Leon fought against the urge to look back again and again.

It seems like there will be a woman when I look back. A woman shamelessly enjoying a bubble bath alone in his bathtub.



In that moment, as I opened the bedroom door, I unknowingly harbored a foolish hope. That perhaps, when I opened this door, the woman would be there.

No, I had such thoughts from the moment I opened the door to the annex. That woman must be somewhere in this annex.



Since some time, for Leon, the annex had been the space where that woman was. This place had no existence without that woman.



He was struggling against the impulse to search the entire annex, from the torture chamber in the basement to the maid's room in the attic.



Is it really necessary to confirm that it doesn't exist like that?


It was a situation of despair.


Crazy guy. Idiot. Even if I don't believe the hallucinations are real, I wonder if I've really lost my mind or something.


It was when I had forced a smile and stepped out of the shower booth.


I met the eyes of the woman reflected in the mirror. While he was drying her wet hair, the woman, lost in thought, rolled her eyes and snatched the towel away from him.

The day the woman returns? She's coming back, you say. Crazy, huh?


Now I must admit this as well.


She will not come back. She has abandoned him.


The woman has not disappeared. She abandoned him.


As if forced to drink a lethal poison, Leon, who repeatedly refused to accept the truth despite persistent urges, was mocked by Blanchard in his mind.

“No, now I regret loving Grace.”


Loving that woman. Stopping the act of loving that woman. Regretting the love that was once had. And even calling out her name as freely as one wants.

Leon could not do any of it easily, but he did all of it without hesitation. As if he had the right to behave that way in front of him.



Arrogant little brat, who do you think you are?


However, even at that time, Leon knew. Despite both him and her being in the same forsaken situation, he would never be able to say throughout his life that he regretted loving Grace.

In the end, it was nothing at all.


I showed that woman only the truth. Moreover, the person who ultimately freed her from brainwashing was him.

Still, Leon was treated worse than a traitor by that woman.


Even after he promised to entrust everything he had to that woman, she left. No, he was abandoned.


Having completed all the tasks I had to shoulder and trying to leave behind the cruel mockery, tricks, and betrayal she had inflicted on me over the years, the woman abandoned him.

Yeah, you’re still like that.


That woman easily discards him again. He cannot even throw away the broken mirror.


Was it the heart that was torn apart, not the back of the hand?


Leon, lifting his head, gazed at the shattered mirror and felt regret. It was just a mirror, not even that woman's, nor something she cherished. He blamed himself for breaking an item that had merely reflected the woman from time to time, for this absurd reason.

"Welcome."


This time, it was a very common guest at this hour on a weekday.


A young woman wearing a red wine-colored cloche hat adorned with a black ribbon and a black cape with fur trim at the ends stopped at the entrance and looked around inside.

The woman looked wealthy at a glance. This café, not far from the boutique street, was a regular spot for ladies who had finished shopping around this time to enjoy a cup of tea or catch up with friends.

"Do you have company?"


When the waiter approached and asked, the woman shook her head and took off her gloves, which were the same color as her hat. As the thin golden ring sparkled on her left ring finger, the waiter politely indicated the interior, adding a title.



“Madam, you may sit in a place that is comfortable for you.”


Among the many seats, the place the woman chose was right behind the man who had just entered. It wasn't until the woman sat down that the waiter realized that the bulge in the front of the man's cape was not an optical illusion.



"Are you okay?"


"Yes, it's okay."


The pregnant woman clearly seemed uncomfortable, yet she sat with her back turned to the unfamiliar man just a short distance away. Then, without taking off her sunglasses, she scanned the menu placed on the table.

Although the sunglasses made it difficult to see her eyes, the bright red lipstick did not seem out of place but rather suited her, suggesting that she was undoubtedly a beauty.

“Um….”


The woman brushed her black hair, which fell to the middle of her nape, behind her ear and seemed to hesitate for a moment before placing her order.

"Please give me cream tea."


“Yes, one cream tea. I will bring it to you right away.”


As the waiter walked away, Grace sighed and stroked her belly.



"Yes, I'm hungry too. Just hang in there a little longer."
In the photo, Leon Winston was still as elegant as a swan and perfect like a god. I had expected that the moment she disappeared, it would be devastatingly shattered, but why?

No. If you're still trying to find me, it means you don't know the face behind that mask.


Grace pulled her drooping mouth corners back up and smiled brightly again. This time, the corners of her eyes joined in too.



"Hello, sweetheart. Are you doing well without me?"


Should I call and tease you like this?


Not even a child, really. Grace let out a small sigh and grabbed a few sheets of newspaper, flipping through them all at once. When she saw the classifieds, she began to read the job listings one by one.

The one word that Grace was looking for in those countless advertisements was just one.


Slaughterhouse operator.


It was the term that the Blanchard Revolutionary Army used to refer to themselves in secret. They compared themselves to butchers for slaughtering the piglets of the monarchy.

Since the Blackburn raid, there have been an increasing number of newspaper advertisements for finding butchers or butchers looking for jobs. If those job ads contained meaningless numbers disguised as phone numbers or listed a rough location in the city where a slaughterhouse could not possibly exist, then it was actually a code used by self-proclaimed revolutionary remnants.



Those who barely escaped from the stronghold or royal palace that had been wiped out gather to establish a new hideout and collect other remnants.

I have not yet been able to pick up the phone line, and since I don't even know when I should move to a new hideout, if a newspaper ad appears saying that a slaughterhouse is looking for workers, those who have already secured a hideout nearby will post job ads to inform about the date and place of the meeting.


And the advertisement I saw last week had this code written in it.


Wednesday at 2 PM, Dunwich Café Dahlia.


Grace had been in Dunwich, in the central region, for a few days trying to find Café Dahlia. She not only asked taxi drivers but even bought a local phone directory to inquire, and it seems she finally managed to find it.

The middle-aged man sitting behind her did not seem to fit in with this urban café. Although they were meeting for the first time, the scent of 'comradeship' was already in the air.


Grace quietly sighed, listening to the noise made by the man behind her.
"Welcome."


The sound of a door opening was heard from behind. When I subtly turned my head to check, sure enough, a young man in attire that did not fit the occasion was standing at the door, looking around inside.

"Here."


As the waiter approached, the young man shook his head and walked over here. Grace turned her head again and took another bite of the scone. Behind her, a brief conversation passed about whether someone was looking for the butcher, and then the sound of a chair scraping was heard.


The two lowered their voices and whispered, and as their guard seemed to relax, they conversed in voices that were loud enough for Grace to hear clearly.

"A hungry pregnant woman with a scone in her mouth wouldn't be suspicious or scary at all."


As Grace was about to spread jam and cream on the remaining half of the scone, the conversation was approaching its intended purpose.



"There are three of us on our side, including me."


"It's cramped and uncomfortable, but I can manage with three. Where are the other two now?"


"About an hour away by tram from here..."


The two planned to bring the rest of the group and meet again in this area at night, then sought to conclude the meeting. Grace quickly emptied her teacup, took four golden coins from her wallet, and placed them on the table.

Grace left the spot before the two people. After stepping outside, she stood behind the corner of two buildings, watching the entrance of the café. After a while, a young man came out first and walked away in the opposite direction, disappearing.



After about 2 minutes had passed, the middle -aged man finally appeared outside the café. Just as the man was walking this way, Grace quickly opened her bag and took something out.

As the man rounded the corner and brushed past her, Grace turned her back and pretended to fix her makeup.


"Makeup is such a hassle, really."


It was noticeable that the lipstick was smudged in places on the lips reflected in the compact mirror. Grace quickly took out her lipstick to fill in the empty spots while glancing at the end of the alley. The man was walking somewhere calmly, seemingly unaware that he was being followed.



Grace followed the man while keeping a good distance. As the shops became scarcer, a clothesline strung between
and entered a phone booth. It was the end of the month, so the bank was crowded, and no one would remember the appearance of a woman using the phone at this time.

"Please connect to 5214 Berkshire West in Winsford."


Grace dialed a familiar phone number and added any name that came to mind.


"It's Bridget Davis."


Before long, the voice of the other person could be heard.


[This is the 1st Special Missions Unit. How can I assist you?]


As always, it was a tone filled with strict discipline.


“Hello. I called the number on the wanted poster. Is that the place where they receive rebel tips?”


Grace asked as if she knew everything, pretending it was her first tip-off.


[Yes, that's right.]


"Well, it seems that someone I know is a rebel."


After that, she conveyed the appearance of the two men she saw at the café, the location of their hideout, and the time and place they would meet tonight.

As soon as we safely achieved the purpose of coming to Denuich, we had to leave without a moment to catch our breath. It was only a matter of time before the astute commander of the 1st Special Task Force figured out the identity of the informant.



I went straight to the hotel where I had been staying, loaded the luggage I had left with the concierge into a taxi, and headed to the train station. Then I bought a train ticket to my next destination. The train was scheduled to arrive in 30 minutes.



It was cold waiting outside, so I went into the waiting room of the platform. Looking around at the sparsely occupied seats, Grace sat down on a bench in front of a pillar.

“I will place it here for you.”


"Thank you."


The porter, who had been carrying my bag since I got out of the taxi, placed the bag neatly at my feet. When I gave him a golden coin, the man politely bowed and went outside.

Grace took a newspaper out of her bag and unfolded it. Then she squinted her eyes while staring straight at the 'perfect' man in the photo.



Right now, your insides are burning black, aren’t they?










Leon gazed at his reflection in the window with raindrops streaming down, with an indifferent look in his eyes.


The medals have increased again. As the face that recoils at the smell of blood from the medals flickers before him, he tightly shuts his eyes and turns his head. It’s a hallucination stuck in his mind, yet he closes his eyes and turns his head. It was a futile act.



"Ah, Colonel Winston."


At the sound of my call, Leon turned around. Commander Davenport was entering the commander's office.


"I was waiting."


It is only natural since you called. Leon followed the commander into the office. The commander, sitting behind the desk and offering him a seat, suddenly narrowed his eyes.

"How did your hand end up like that?"


It was to ask about the bandage wrapped around his right hand. Leon sat down in the chair in front of the desk without a reply. Perhaps his stiff expression was enough of an answer, as the commander took a dark caramel-colored cigar from the box and offered it to him. Leon accepted it without declining.


"It must be the first day back at the headquarters after the operation."


Only after the smoke that had thickly obscured the view cleared did the commander open his mouth to speak again.


“How was it? Do you like your private office?”


Leon nodded absentmindedly, exhaling a long stream of white smoke.


"It's not bad."


From this year, Leon was the head of the First Special Operations Unit, not the head of the Domestic Information Division of the Western Command.

"The evidence of wrongdoing has vanished, so I would actually feel relieved."


The commander frowned as if displeased with his sarcasm.


"Well, it wouldn't be entirely pleasant for you that the woman has disappeared."


If all the evidence had been neatly destroyed, it would have been better, but the woman, who is the biggest piece of evidence and witness to the author's misconduct, is roaming somewhere out in the world. For the commander, living with a ticking time bomb that could go off at any moment must feel like losing the detonator.


“Colonel Winston.”


The commander composed himself and changed the subject.


"I suppose you know that I called you today for another reason."


Of course. Leon did not forget the terms of this deal. He placed the envelope of documents that he was leaning against the chair's leg on the commander's desk.

The commander opened the envelope and carefully examined its contents. Even after obtaining what he had wanted, the author's expression did not brighten. It couldn't be helped. What was inside the envelope was evidence and records of the assassination operation of the late king that were related, either directly or indirectly, to the commander.



"I hope there is no copy."


Leon shook his head to indicate that there was none. There is no copy. Of course, there are other things, though.


As soon as he finished his business, he returned to the headquarters of the 1st Special Operations Division located one floor below. Unlike 30 minutes ago, the atmosphere in the office was chaotic. Soldiers were busily moving around, and several officers were engaged in heated conversations with someone on the phone.


"Major, have you arrived?"


Captain Hana, who was the first to spot Leon among the officers gathered in front of the map having a serious conversation, saluted.



“What’s going on?”


"A tip just came in a little while ago."


The moment the captain answered, Campbell quickly added, not missing the subtle change in his complexion.



"This is a report related to the hideout of the remnants."
As soon as Grace entered the hotel room, she threw off her shoes and hat and flopped onto the bed.


"Haah... I feel like I can finally live now."


A groan unintentionally escaped. There wasn't a part of my body, whether it was my legs or waist, that wasn't sore.

If it had been in the past, I wouldn't have been this exhausted after traveling four hours by train.


Lying down on the bed without taking off my clothes or washing was something that had never happened.


"Let’s take a short break…."


Grace took off the thin gold ring she wore to pretend she was married and placed it on the side table, letting out a sigh. The clock on the side table pointed to 9 PM.

At least the makeup should be removed....


If I lay here like this, it was obvious I would fall asleep. Then, 'just a moment' would only end when the sun rises tomorrow.



When I was on the train, I had ambitious plans to fill the bathtub and take a bath once I got to the hotel, but now I didn't even have the strength to get up and take off my clothes. Grace, lying down, lazily peeled off her coat and clothes one by one and haphazardly piled them on one side of the bed. Seeing this, the man with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder would surely be horrified.



"Ah... it's so soft."


She stretched out her legs and let out a pleasant sigh. The businessman who got on in the same car on the way here recommended that this hotel had affordable rates and good facilities, and it really was true.

"Hoo...."


Since escaping from Blackburn, I have been constantly moving from hotel to hotel. At first, I didn't plan it this way. I intended to head straight to King's Road from Anderton, find my mother's inheritance, and then make a fake passport to board a ship leaving this country from the southern port.


However, in my haste, I forgot something; Christmas is a public holiday.


What could be worse than that it just happened to be Friday? On top of that, the day after Christmas was also a public holiday.



So the Royal Heritage Bank only opened its doors three days later, on the 28th, and by the time Grace went to claim her inheritance, flyers searching for her were already posted all over the kingdom.

At that time, I thought that a wanted notice had been thoroughly issued at the border areas and ports, so I gave up on fleeing abroad.

I will leave the child behind.


No matter how I compared them, there were more reasons to leave behind than to take along. In fact, the only reason to take along was just one proposition without certainty or logic: "Because I gave birth to them...?"

The strange sense of responsibility that I couldn't determine where it came from was only uncomfortable. After all, the child was not born out of Grace's will to create.

The person who created it by their own will should take responsibility.


I was vaguely thinking of giving the child to that man after giving birth. Moreover, I already had a feeling that the child would be one that I would have a hard time handling.

The child was quiet when they bought a cheap turkey sandwich for lunch, but when they had an expensive salmon dish in the dining car, they became excited and danced.

"I'm amazed. Being picky about food is just me…."


Grace let out a sigh after talking to herself.


However, can that man truly be a good father? He is merely a chess piece in the operation to wipe out their base and a child made to serve as an anchor to keep her in place. There is no way he genuinely feels affection.

That man, in the first place, doesn't even know how to love properly.


Under the count's father, this child grew up as a motherless illegitimate child. And it was glaringly obvious that the man would eventually give up Grace and marry the archduchess, causing this child to fall into disgrace.

Should we just send him to an orphanage? Or should we find a good family for him ourselves?


Grace has finally begun to understand her mother's heart a little.


"I should have sent her to the orphanage…"


The mother did not say those words because she disliked or hated her daughter. Just as the mother wished for her to live a normal life, Grace also hoped that the unborn child would grow up normally.

Because Grace also didn't know how to love properly.


In the world, there are so many couples who want children, but it seemed wrong for me, who doesn’t want them, to raise them in a half-hearted family.


Having money doesn't mean that one can raise a child properly. Just look at that man, and you can tell.
Don't bear the yoke of your parents; live freely. Even though the people you call your parents are this incompetent...



"Still alive."










If the informant is a young woman, the accuracy of the report was not a superstition.


When I indicated only the cases from the report records that actually led to arrests, it turned out that all the informants were indeed young women.

Naturally, the names of the informants were different. Moreover, since all the recipients were different, it could not be confirmed whether they had the same voice.

Nevertheless, Leon was convinced that all the 'honorary members' of the 1st Special Mission Unit were the same woman, namely, Grace Liddell.

The information provided was quite detailed. Moreover, there was something that all the informants felt in common. Even though the informant always identified themselves as either an acquaintance of the remnants or a café waitress, they reportedly did not show any signs of anxiety about whether their anonymity would be guaranteed when they provided information.



That's the woman.


So far, I have marked and analyzed the locations of the hideouts reported by the woman on the map, but no discernible pattern has appeared. I do not know how she found out about the hideouts, but it seemed that she was just moving in the order that I became aware of.


Is it possible that among the rebels captured based on that woman's tip, there is anyone who has met the woman? After sending Campbell to various detention camps to interrogate them, I heard some quite interesting stories.

When I see a pregnant woman wearing sunglasses, the army shows up within a few days.


There are rumors circulating in the camp. To them, she was nothing less than the 'woman in white,' a symbol of misfortune.



What is the symbol of misfortune? That woman is the informant.


It seemed that the woman made a tip-off call only after personally tailing someone and confirming the location of the hideout with her own eyes.


At great risk.
"That's enough. You can leave work when the time comes."


Leon muttered, interrupting the words of the overly cautious private.


“Anyway, the other guys will be coming in soon.”


Another day has passed like this. Without any harvest.


Thud. Thud.


The baseball rose to a precarious height, almost touching the ceiling, before falling from his hand. Leon lay on the sofa, throwing the baseball up and catching it while lost in thought again.

I had no idea that the woman boldly declared her survival in the most unexpected, or rather, the most fitting place.


So far, there have been a total of four reports. They were spaced four to ten days apart.


The last call was last Wednesday, so today, Friday, is the 9th day.


It's still time to call again.


Leon mechanically threw and caught the baseball while recalling the information he had monotonously repeated over the past few days.



Sunglasses. Yeah, they probably bought that first. The eyes are the most decisive factor.


Should I somehow involve the rebels and try to impose a ban on sunglasses? Leon chuckled at the thought. Only a dictator could pull something like that off.

Then we could also ban hair dye.


'Black hair... Black-haired Daisy... Black-haired Grace Liddle...'


Leon's lips, which I had imagined, gently curled up. It might not be necessary to prohibit hair dye.


It was quite an alluring sight. If it had been in front of me, I wouldn't have been able to hold back, I would have lifted my skirt and torn my underwear. What happens next is obvious.

"F*cking...."


To be strutting through a bustling city of men in such a way that makes one want to pounce on them. It was fortunate that it was clear at a glance that there was a master to this body. No one would dare to make a move.

[Is this the correct place to report?]


It sounded as if the voice was slightly hoarse. It was that familiar voice I heard in the morning.


The woman's voice pierced through his ears, sending a subtle shiver throughout his entire body. It felt as if every cell in his body was awakening. He had to bite his teeth to suppress the impulse to immediately ask where he was.

Leon picked up a pencil rolling on the desk and hastily scribbled on the notebook held out by the private.


Yes, that's right. Where are you?


The private, unaware of what the woman had said, recited the words he had written down into the receiver of the phone.



"Yes, that's right. Where are you?"


[This is Bilford in Camden.]


Leon had to grit his teeth and suppress a laugh. Camden, of all places. Moreover, Bilford was only a four-hour drive from here.



That woman stepped onto his land without a trace of fear. This also felt like an unbearably cruel mockery.


[I think the person living in the same alley is probably a rebel...]


He scribbled in his notebook while the woman was making her report.


Camden Bilford. Track him down.


The private promptly stood up from his seat and followed his gesture, entering the aide's office and closing the door. That guy will now contact the phone company to investigate the operator on Winsford's side who connected this call. By tracing it back this way, he would be able to narrow down the location from which the call was made.


[Going south at the intersection of Newton Avenue and Belmont Avenue....]


Leon sat in the chair where the private had been, quietly listening to the woman's voice chattering away without a care, and let out a sigh.



[Madison….]


At that moment, the woman's voice abruptly stopped. In the tense atmosphere that felt like a silent argument was taking place, Leon, who was listening to the woman's silence, was the first to speak.

[Should I now call you Count, Your Excellency, or should I call you Major?]


"Hmm, I didn't expect you to hear about me."


[Then, of course. I'm so bored I could die. Don't you feel like you're still caught even after getting away from you?]


“If that’s the case, it might be better to get caught….”


[You know this is all thanks to me, right? Be thankful for the rest of your life.]


"I know. So I'll be paying off debts for a lifetime…."


While I was staring at the still firmly closed door of the assistant's office and dragging out the conversation, the woman suddenly brought up a new topic.

[Ah, right. I have a confession to make to you.]


“…What confession?”


[I lied to you.]


"I will forgive you. So please come back."


The woman, pretending to be generous while complaining that she hadn't even listened to the lies, went ahead and made a confession that Leon hadn't even asked for.

[In fact, there were not three people involved in your father's matter that night, but four.]


"What?"


[Do you remember Fred Wilkins? That treacherous bastard who deserved to die.]


"Uh, so I killed you."


[That guy's father, David Wilkins, was also at the cabin that night.]


The moment Leon recalled seeing that name on the list of leaders imprisoned in the camp, he clenched his pencil as if to break it.



[I heard that person made a fatal mistake. I don't know what the mistake was. I saw Jonathan Riddle Senior comforting Uncle Dave.]

[...What was that sound?]


Did the woman pause and ask because she heard the sound of the door breaking?


"Oh no, something slipped from my hand."


[Calm down a bit.]


The woman seemed to think that he slammed his fist on the desk.


"Ah, is that why you ran away? Were you scared that I would get angry with you? I won’t be angry, so come back, okay?"



There were two stations in Bilford. From now on, Leon's goal was to stall until the scenery arrived and he found the woman. His mouth had already started to dry up.

[So you're saying that my duty as bait is over, and I should return to the trap? Think carefully. Would you want to go back to the man who humiliated you so much? You're just a damn bastard who used me for your desires, so why should I go back.]



"I didn't use you because of my desires; I was trying to free you from your brainwashing. No matter how much I told you the truth, you didn't believe me. I had no choice but to have you experience it for yourself. I know it's an extreme method that is far from common sense, but if I hadn't had my child, you would have gone back under that demon who instructed you in the art of seduction and been used in the same way."


[Great. Whether it's a self-defense or an excuse. If you quit the military, try being a lawyer.]


"Whatever it is, my way eventually worked, didn’t it? You can’t deny that. Thanks to me, you’ve opened your eyes to the truth."



[Ah, I see. I'm crying from gratitude. To think that in return, all I ask is to bear your child and spend my life tied to you, you're really making a losing deal. Oh my, Your Excellency! At this rate, the count's house will be ruined.]

The woman sarcastically taunted and then spoke with a heavy voice, cutting off any further discussion.


[I will take my revenge and you will gain the title. Our deal ends here.]


"You’re mistaken; your revenge is not over yet. That’s why you’re struggling to roam across the country with that body. You don’t need to do that; just a finger from you, and I’ll take care of exterminating those guys, so come back."



[Is that all you can say, come back? I'm already getting bored. I'm going to hang up.]



As the woman was about to hang up, Leon quickly brought up another topic.
The woman, who had been silent for a moment, suddenly made a demand.


[Try begging me.]


Leon was at a loss for words. The woman's intention to ask for a favor was all too apparent. But he had no other options.



"Come back."


[Is that how you pray? Pray properly.]


In his life, Leon, who had never begged anyone, struggled to swallow the bitter humiliation rising up to his chin and let out a sigh-like word with great difficulty.

“…Please.”


The woman burst into a deafening laugh, finding something incredibly amusing, and suddenly, she removed her smile and scolded him.



[You forgot something important.]


Leon groaned while covering his face with one hand and began to speak again.


"I'm sorry. I was wrong. So please come back."


It was more of a persuasion than a request. A woman with keen perception wouldn't miss that.


You apologize too easily, don't you? I don't feel any signs of reflection at all.


"You probably won't feel it just by hearing it on the phone."


[The rain is already showing a bad attitude. And didn't the great Captain Winston say so? Make sure to clarify what you want when you're borrowing.]

The woman moved as he had anticipated. She intended to give Leon the same humiliation I experienced. He tapped the pencil on the desk, contemplating, and began to pull out the words he had organized in his mind one by one.

"I was harsh on you, I hated you, all of that was excessive, and I will never do it again. I will also forgive what you did to me. I want to clean up the past and start again with you. So please give me one more chance."

The woman did not answer.



“Please.”
As he was at a loss for words, the woman abruptly hung up the phone, leaving only laughter behind.


"Grace!"


By the time I called out late, that woman couldn't hear it.










I could not catch that woman in the end.


No, I caught it. Almost.


The woman was caught by the officers dispatched to Billford Central Station. The problem was that the officers did not realize how cunning she was.

They were momentarily deceived by a woman pretending to feel pain, so instead of going to the police station, they went to the hospital, and while they were distracted, the woman vanished in the crowded hospital.

As he ran toward Bilford, the woman disappeared again.


A week later, a letter addressed to Leon arrived at the headquarters of the 1st Special Operations Unit. The sender's name was shamelessly 'Daisy Abington.'

Leon, who checked what was inside, could not hide his disappointment.


The contents were a notepad explaining how to find the messages from the Blanchard rebels in newspaper advertisements and how to decipher the codes.

It was an expression from the doctor that they would no longer provide reports.


Leon still couldn't give up a glimmer of hope. He stationed troops in ambush around the hideout of the remnants he found and the rendezvous point, following the method that woman had shown him. That woman might still be unable to shake off the thought of revenge and could be tracking the remnants.


They even pretended to be remnants and published fake ads in newspapers to bait others.


However, as a month was approaching, the 'pregnant woman in sunglasses' had not appeared at either the meeting point or the hideout. Only the ratlings had shown up unexpectedly.


As soon as there was a way to check the woman's safety and whereabouts, she vanished again.
As I do not know that woman.


"Campbell."


As Leon gestured, Campbell, who had been standing behind him, began to open and read the folder he had been holding in his hand.



"Led the Oakley postal train raid, planted a bomb along the parade route for the king's 20th anniversary of his reign to attempt to assassinate the king, infiltrated a military base with an accomplice after arson, forged identity cards and official documents…."



As Leon raised his left hand, the recital came to a halt. He gazed at Jonathan Riddle Jr.'s face, which had turned ashen compared to earlier, and squinted his eyes.

"You do not deny it."


It couldn't be helped. This is all based on the testimonies of those who were complicit in the criminal act.


"It’s a crime that would get you dragged straight to a prison camp."


The woman's hand gripping her husband's sleeve trembled noticeably, and at the moment when an uncontainable sob burst forth, Leon smiled at her and added.

"Ah, some of them also involved your wife..."


Finally, Jonathan Riddle Jr. clenched his teeth and provided the answer he wanted.


“If you have any questions, I will answer them all, so do not touch my wife and children.”


Leon gestured to Campbell. The soldiers, who had been rummaging through the living room and kitchen, immediately went outside. When they tried to take the women and children out, the man blocked their way.

"Don't worry. I just want to talk quietly."


The chaotic room soon fell silent. As Joe watched Masa and the kids being led by the soldiers towards the farmer's house through the window, he reluctantly sat down facing the devil at the insistence to do so.

The devil took a cigar from the cigar case placed on the table and offered it, but Joe shook his head in rejection.


After that, Winston asked if Joe knew the whole story of the sweep. Since the only thing he heard was from the radio, and there had been no contact from Blanchard's side since that day, Joe had no idea. Joe's expression twisted upon hearing Winston's 'kind' explanation.

important was missing.


"That's all."


"No, that's not all."


With a sigh, white smoke poured out. Leon warned the guy who was scheming something trivial while suppressing his rising anger.



"I see you don't really know who I am. I've been someone who has discerned the lies of your comrades for 10 years. And according to my experience, you are lying right now. Don't think you can deceive me clumsily."

Whether that woman is truly a blood relative, he stubbornly kept talking about something else without yielding.


"It’s no longer a comrade."


"That's right. The guys who share a cell with you in the camp must think the same way. You're not a comrade, but a traitor."



Honestly, if I don't confess, I'm threatened with being sent to a camp, and I'm shaken. This is a place filled with those caught because of Grace's betrayal. They will surely take revenge on him and his family.

Damn it. Jo kept swallowing the same words inside.


I should have caught you that day.


It seemed that something was going to be done. It's a great relief that the blame was shifted to the perpetrators rather than oneself, but to think that it would directly confront them for revenge, rather than just revealing the location of the base.



Knock. Knock.


As the neatly trimmed fingertip of the index finger began to tap the table in a steady rhythm, thoughts of sorrow abruptly halted.



He looked blankly at Winston, who was applying silent pressure to reveal what he had hidden. It was perplexing. If he had achieved his main purpose of avenging his father by wiping out the base, then that should have been enough; he couldn't understand why Winston had come all the way here demanding more.


"What exactly do you want to know? If it's about Grace's whereabouts, I don't know. That's something I want to know more than anyone."



At those words, Winston's expression turned fierce.



"I asked what kind of conversation we had."
As Jo nodded, Leon wrapped one hand around his forehead and closed his eyes.


"Damn it…."


When I told my brother to verify the truth surrounding my birth and the intrigue, the woman was confronted with even more horrifying truths. It was such a terrible truth that it's remarkable she didn't take her own life on the spot.

When I returned to Chesterfield, I couldn't suppress the regret that I should have given up the mission and brought her back. I already knew that the woman's brainwashing had been lifted, yet blinded by the desire to make her betray her comrades and leave her alone in the woman's world, I failed to see that she was suffering immense pain at that moment.



Leon groaned in the shock that the woman must have experienced.


I had such doubts in her boarding room.


"What kind of life have you lived?"


And now that question has been completely resolved.


Contempt, coldness, discrimination, and lies.


The Grace Lee family lived in the midst of ugly malice, to put it simply.


And the woman grew up not knowing the malice surrounding me, just as a fish in the sea does not feel the water.

After realizing that, the woman's eyes looking back at her hometown must have seen not heaven, but hell.


Those disgusting demons. Just because they received the enemy's blood, they had a vile purpose to confine and raise a child in the village, systematically brainwashing them.

It's a plan where a dog eats another dog and a pig eats another pig.


Perhaps it was grown with such a purpose from the beginning, so the rebel leadership might have given that woman the order to seduce him. To them, the daughter of the woman who seduced and killed his father would be quite a satisfying plot of a movie, killing a son in the same manner.


Leon could not shake off the feeling of humiliation that he was also used in their perverse games.


"You didn't know?"


He asked Joe, who was observing me with eyes full of bewilderment, as if interrogating him.



"I only found out a few years ago. As soon as I learned, I washed my hands."
Leon couldn't believe his ears. The woman who had been playing at the top of his head, despite being a captive, and the one who, around that time, didn't know how to cry no matter what he did, was now crying.

I wondered if you knew I had left, whether being alone made me cry like this, but it was only for a moment.


"I will kill you... Please don't throw it away...."


It was sleep talking.


What kind of sleep talking is this?


Am I having a nightmare? I just laughed it off, saying I have all sorts of strange sleeping habits.


Now that I see it, that was not a nightmare but reality.


“Just what did those authors force the young girl to do?”


I shook my head at Leon's probing.


"Grace had nothing to do with that."


“How can you be so sure when you weren't there?”


Jo let out a deep sigh and reluctantly expressed it.


"Adults sometimes talked about the events of that night. Grace's name didn't even come up. And she was only eleven years old. She was so young for her age that she was crazy about the carousel and playing house that little kids enjoy."



"I know that too."


I doubted despite knowing. Even after hearing the woman's apology and explanation, I didn't trust her until the end and remained doubtful.



That woman was ultimately a victim too. No different from me.


With her eyes gently closed, as she struggled to suppress the murderous intent that she didn't know whom to direct first, the woman's brother asked with a distinctly suspicious expression.

"Why are you asking something like this?"



When he opened his eyes, the other person was staring at him with a strange look. It was a look that suggested she
It was only when the major let out a dissatisfied sigh that Campbell regained his senses and subdued Jonathan Riddle Jr., putting handcuffs on him.

"Major, are you okay?"


I approached late and asked, but the supervisor spoke nonsense.


"I thought the feeling would be similar... but your punches are weaker than my younger sister's."


It was a feeling of regret. It sounded as if he wanted to hit that woman who had disappeared, and Campbell felt embarrassed.



"Well, I may not resemble a fist, but I do resemble the way one rushes in without knowing the situation."


While Leon sneered and smoked a cigar, the woman's brother writhed in agony, bound.


"My younger sibling has done nothing wrong! If there's any sin, it's my parents who committed it! But why take revenge on Grace! What did she do!"

It was not an act driven by vengeance. No, it might have been so once or twice. Perhaps even more often. Now, it would be ridiculous to deny that the needle on the scale measuring that woman had tilted more toward affection than hatred.



“No, that’s not it. They were already famous demons from the beginning, so what could you expect? We should blame those who sent my brother to the demons.”

조 twisted his face and spat out curses through clenched teeth.


"Damn it…. My mother hoped that Grace wouldn’t repeat the same fate…."


In that moment, Leon's gaze, which was igniting the cigarette, turned displeased. How could he compare my woman to Angela Lee, who lived a miserable life and died? It was even more unpleasant to hear such a statement that placed me on the same level as a pimp named Jonathan Lee.


Leon asserted through the tightly clenched cigar.


"I won't repeat it."


He would not exploit that woman. On top of that, his intention to dedicate everything he had remained unchanged.


"If you just cooperate with me, that won't happen."



Joe, who had his head buried in the table, snorted and then looked up to ask.
Joe, sitting on the old, worn rocking chair next to the entrance, took a cigarette and approached Winston leisurely.


"State your business."


As I stood in front, smoking a cigarette and loitering as if I were watching the monkeys at the zoo, he suddenly blurted out as if annoyed. Only then did Jo throw a question that completely changed my suspicion into certainty.

"Did you meet Grace when you were young?"


Winston glared at him for a moment instead of answering, then turned his gaze back to the field. Not denying it meant he was indeed a poet.

“Since you asked about after going to Abington Beach? How did that happen? Surely, it can't be that the adults had a secret meeting with the children.”

You speak of disgusting stories so nonchalantly. Leon replied curtly, narrowing his eyes.


"At that time, that woman didn't know the norms of the outside world. She came to play on someone else's beach house and peeked at my face while sitting in a tree."

"Ah.... That guy does look like a charming blonde man, but he's weak."


It's amusing that they would downplay it as something to merely "tolerate," so Leon let out a short chuckle.


"Then it just so happens that the one I was chasing after is the son of the target. Anyway, that guy…."


The woman's older brother murmured to himself for a while and then laughed while holding a low-quality cigarette that emitted a terrible smell.

"So, is this an unforgettable first love?"


It was a ridiculous suggestion. As if even I, asking, thought this was absurd.


Why is this ridiculous?


From the rude attitude of boldly prying into extremely personal matters to the incredulous sneering expression, everything was utterly unpleasant.

"Ha, I was wondering why you were so obsessed with my sister, who is the daughter of our enemy, and it turns out there was such a story behind it. So you ended up ruining your already failed first love for revenge? That's really unfortunate."




Leon glared at the mocking guy, closed his eyes tightly, and pressed his hand against his throbbing temple.
"Brainwashing."


Zoe nodded at Leon's words.


"It was terrible. I tried every possible method to break the brainwashing, but none of them worked. So I directly released them, telling them to take it off with their own hands."

When she hatched and was reborn, I thought he would imprint on her, but the woman unfurled her folded wings and flew away.



Winston, who was suddenly stopped with a sneer that he didn’t know to whom to send it, was gazed at by Jo with a puzzled look. I thought he was using Grace solely for revenge and success, but it seemed otherwise. Is it really true, or has my eyesight already started to deteriorate?


"By the way, it seems you have quite a bit of money...."


Winston, with a glint in his eye, suddenly brought up an unexpected topic.


“When do you plan to stop pretending to live as a beggar worker?”


He seemed to say those words as if he was looking straight into his heart, and Jo felt momentarily flustered.


No. It may just be a wild guess.


“…A disguise, huh. If that's really the case, that would be great, damn it.”


I pretended to smoke bitterly again on purpose, but it didn't work.


"Are you not preparing for immigration?"





"Here, there are countless soldiers eager to capture you, just like the old 'allies,' so it's only natural that an ordinary life is already ruined."



Winston, who had been gazing at Joy's face as if observing it, let out a snicker.


"That's right. The person who has been watching you all this time is me."


“…why is that?”



"Why is that? Isn't it natural that I cannot allow the descendants of the woman who killed my father to live
"The world, where remnants who would try to kill all Lydis are overflowing, is dangerous. The safest place is under me, and that applies to both that woman and that side."

While the opponent couldn't refute, Leon took out his business card and tucked it into the pocket of the worn-out overalls.



“As the head of the family, think carefully.”


The soldiers who finished searching began to get into the military truck without any harvest. As Winston's shiny face disappeared into the black sedan, Joe, who continued to glare in that direction, couldn't hold back any longer and approached the car the moment the driver started the engine.


"Hey."


When I tapped on the backseat window, Winston rolled down the window and raised an eyebrow as he asked what I needed.



"I have a favor to ask."


"Request?"


"Jimmy, that son of a bitch who deserves to be killed. No, just beat him up enough for him to regret being alive."


Winston gazed at Joel with a subtle expression that was neither a smile nor a frown.


“Do I look like a thug under you?”


"Why? Isn't it an easy request?"


As I smiled slyly, Winston scoffed. Anyway, since it wasn't a refusal, it was just a moment of tapping on the car's roof as if to encourage it, before stepping back.

"The inheritance that woman received, it must be gold bars, right?"


How did you find that out? Unexpectedly, while Jo was stunned by the accurate remark, Winston answered before he could even ask.



"How did you find out? They sell gold bars every time a child is born. It would be difficult to cover hospital expenses with the wages of workers, so there was no choice."




"I only realized today that it was an inheritance. Thanks to you. That means that woman also received gold bars. The gold bars you sold were all minted at the Royal Heritage Bank and had consecutive serial numbers. Your so-

[Where could we have gone?]


At that moment, Grace couldn't help but burst into laughter. The desperate lyrics were completely out of place with the cheerful melody.



“Where are you wandering this cold winter, leaving my warm arms behind? Huh? I'm worried.”


The man's voice, which casually and lightly wrapped up his desperate feelings, came to mind.


[Where could our self be tonight?]


Where else? You're at room 1115 of the Fraser Hotel in Wakefield City.


"By the way, is our child doing well?"


You're so good that it's a problem.


Grace took a small piece of cake from the side table and immediately took a sip of ginger ale. Perhaps it was because the uninvited resident in her belly had grown significantly lately, she had to constantly have ginger ale in her mouth to help with digestion.



There are now 10 weeks left until the eviction of the unauthorized resident.


It was impossible to move around here and there with a body so heavy that even using a bathtub felt overwhelming.

Moreover, I couldn't give birth to my child in the hotel room.


Surely that man must have placed a bounty on him throughout the entire kingdom's hospitals. After ten weeks, he will be eagerly anticipating that the rat will walk right into the trap.

Do you think I'm that stupid?


Grace was browsing through a map book that was laid beside her, tapping on an advertisement in terms of lifestyle information.



"Hmm...."


The location and price were both reasonable.


[24-hour security, concierge service.]


It's safe there. There is always someone on standby to run errands, so there's no need to go out. But the problem is…




[Active resident exchange.]
Soon, her gaze shifted to the handbag placed on the vanity.


"I guess I should sell some gold bars."










Jimmy watched the devil with trembling eyes. Sitting facing each other just two steps apart without a table felt like being stripped bare and thrown in front of a wild beast.

However, even if there is a table in between, I already know well that I cannot escape from that devil's insane violence. The tattoo saying 'death row inmate' that is still vividly visible on my hands tied to the armrests is proof of that.



It seemed that it had been over a month since I was moved from the northern area to the new detention center in the west. I had thought I would be sent to the government detention center, where the comrades are mostly imprisoned, but the leadership decided to transfer me to a temporary detention center established in a prison near Winsford. It appeared to be an intention to keep me close to the headquarters for continued interrogation.


However, such speculation fell flat as no one looked for him for quite a while. It was only when he was on the brink of madness, trapped in the solitary confinement, that Winston came to visit. Even so, there was no reason to be glad about it.



Why did you suddenly come?


The only thing that was not sudden was the content of the question.


"Tell me the circumstances that led to that woman being infiltrated under me, without omitting anything."


It was also a question about Grace.


However, it was unexpected to throw a question completely unrelated to their whereabouts.


As the author interspersed questions throughout, explaining the process of infiltrating Grace as Winston's maid, the other person's face became increasingly stony.

"Ah, speaking of which, you mentioned that you had encountered them when you were young."


After a moment of silence, Winston drew his own conclusion.



“So she never said she would infiltrate. You just forced her to.”
The pain, as if crushing me without any time to avoid it, pierced through the top of my foot. Winston, looking down at Jimmy with contempt as he screamed and bled, stepped outside and casually remarked.

"This is a gift from Jo, not me."


Tonight, his bedroom looked like an empty room without an owner.


In front of the bed bathed in bluish moonlight, the woman's slippers were neatly placed once again tonight, so very neatly. Leon shut the door that he had barely managed to open, clenching his eyes tightly.

The place you turned your back on is the torture chamber. It's the same here; there is no owner.


It was something that could have invited ridicule, but sitting in front of the large table, his face gazing at the empty bed showed no hint of a smile.

Master, you say.


The master of this torture chamber is him, calling that woman the master. Grace Lee was just a prisoner confined in his torture chamber.



A prisoner.


Knowing all the truth, I found myself questioning again. Has that woman really committed sins enough to be called

⦁	prisoner? At that time.
From that perspective, the woman was clearly a prisoner. She was a rebel who had illegally infiltrated a military facility and the private residence of a military officer with impure intentions.

The severity of the sin didn't matter. The carnal desire was dominant, and I was only looking for an excuse to imprison that woman here. Along with that, blind vengefulness also played a part.

But when I opened my eyes, I finally saw.


The woman, helplessly sprawled on the cold floor of the interrogation room, even her jacket proving difficult to withstand, repeatedly heaving and sobbing as if to vomit her humiliation.

A lonely woman who quietly saved the ally that betrayed me, yet received no one’s salvation.


The unjust woman who had to bear the excessive punishment for sins I did not commit.



"Goddamn…."
"I didn't know you were Winston. I didn't even know you were trying to kill your father."


“At that time, I didn't lie about anything except my name.”


"You may want to believe that, but I am not responsible for your father's death."


Yeah, you only spoke the truth, but I'm just getting this kind of verbal abuse...


"The woman I liked was the pure and honest Daisy. Not those deceitful Grace Lees. Got it?"


She didn't do it because she wanted to lie to me.


"You, who have kept your mouth shut until now, are an accomplice too."


No, not at all. She had a reason to keep her mouth shut.


"If you were truly sorry to me, you shouldn't have come here! At the very least, you shouldn't have shamelessly infiltrated under me!"



That wasn't what she meant.


She didn't want to come here. She believed that she had deceived him repeatedly and mocked him, but there was never a time that I wanted to deceive or mock him.

In the end, that woman was also a victim. No different from him. She was also a foolish victim who bore everything alone.



Regardless of the process, he is a criminal who has infiltrated under him. It is also true that he has committed countless heinous crimes as a member of the insurgents.

So the world may call that woman a sinner. However, to Leon Winston, Grace Lee was now nothing more than a scapegoat.



He filled the void left by the collapse of one blind faith with another belief.


You are innocent. As you said, we were enemies back then. You simply believed that the actions of the rebels were right. You couldn't help it either. The guilt lies with those who deceived you.

On the inevitable final day, when the Grace Lee family stands before the judge who separates heaven and hell, the one who will raise their voice the loudest in defense will be Leon Winston, who was once their enemy, adversary, and forsaken lover.




It was a choice of Winston that filled the seat of conscience solely with greed.
was someone who only wished for women to become useless.


Thus, the woman, whose meaning as a means had faded away according to his wishes, was now nothing but a complete purpose to him.



But I don't know where that destination is now, so I got lost.


Wandering and wandering, the place he headed to was nothing more than the bed that woman used. In the early morning and late at night, whenever he opened the door to the interrogation room, the woman was invariably lying on this bed. In the dark, wrapped in a single blanket.


I lay down in the same place because I wanted to feel that woman's gaze. However, all he felt was that woman's loneliness.



Looking up at the pitch-black ceiling, Leon belatedly asked the woman in his mind.


How lonely must you have been here?


In this place where no one saves you, and no one believes in you.


“…Grace.”


I tried to call out the name that always choked me with guilt, but the owner of the name could not hear me.


When that woman was actually in front of him, every time he wanted to call her name, guilt scolded him in his father's voice.



You should hate that name.


Since love was not allowed, I wanted to have her even if it meant using hatred as an excuse. So I tried to lock her up, control her, and brainwash her.

The only difference between Leon and Blanchard's demons was their motivation. He was the same kind of demon.


The desire that had been twisted so much completely transformed during the brief honeymoon period. In that time, which was nothing but deception.

The woman began to imitate love. Annoyed that he was trying to break her heart again, she did the same thing, saying he should experience it too. She generously offered the same fake love.

I didn't know what love was. I still don't know at what moment I should draw a line in that emotion that has been accumulating for over a decade and define it as love.


But now I know one thing. What he sacrificed was not a fake.
He had fulfilled his duties, so he had the right to shake off his father's spirit.


"Grace…."


Having become a body of freedom, Leon was able to speak his true feelings without hesitation.


I'm sorry. I misunderstood you. I poured out hatred that you did not deserve. I understand if you can't forgive me.


Still, I love you. Unashamedly.


But I didn't know where to convey that sincerity. Once again, I just confirmed that I was lost.


"Grace."


He repeated the same name out loud over and over like a child learning and practicing new words. Then he gently closed his eyes. The one in his imagination was right here at this moment.

"I will kill you.... Please don't throw it away...."


As Grace sniffled and talked in her sleep, he put down the glass he was holding. Instead of just laughing it off, Leon embraced her and called her name.

Grace, it's okay. No one has to die. I'm not abandoning you.


But that day he could not do so, and in the end, he was left here all alone.


If only I had known then what I know now. No, at the very least, if I had trusted that woman. He retraced time with futile regrets.



The day I last heard Grace's voice, the moment Grace returned to Chesterfield station. I regretted thinking about wanting to go back to that time, tracing back to the moment I first met the boy and girl on the beach. It was a ridiculous thing. What power could a thirteen-year-old boy possibly have?


I want to go back. I will return. Come back.


Repeating the same words over and over. In that way, lost and going in circles in a disorganized regret, Leon called out only the same name.

Grace. Grace. Grace.



This place, where only her name echoes back instead of mine, was the abyss.
"This guy is the commander’s dog, as testified by the secretary to save the busy person's time, so let's not waste time with unnecessary denial."

That damn thing. The commander stood in the doorway, blinking his eyes, and when I became the topic of conversation, I scolded the secretary in my mind for darting out of sight as if to escape. Every time I asked him to call Colonel Winston or schedule a meeting, his face would brighten, but it seemed he was deceived by that shiny exterior of a madman and fell for the inducements of the interrogation.



"By the way, you need to train them more thoroughly. Leave traces and create witnesses. There were quite a few careless aspects, after all."

Now, standing awkwardly between the two, the officer who was fidgeting like a trapped mouse was the one sent to extract information from Lieutenant Campbell, the colonel's aide.

Information about that child.


Only Lieutenant Campbell and the duty soldiers he designated collected reports of the missing persons. Since they were all tight-lipped, it was impossible to know what kind of reports had been collected so far.

So I told him to rummage through Lieutenant Campbell's desk or do something to find out, and he was carelessly caught.



"I'm sorry, Commander."


The lieutenant lowered his head and stammered.


"Go out."


As I commanded in a growling voice, it ran away outside. I was left speechless at the sight of it slinking past, like it was avoiding a predator that could pounce at any moment, apologizing to the Major in a voice that crawled in.

Of all the things to choose from, you picked that kind of thing.


As he sighed, the major slammed the door shut and strode towards the desk. The commander glared fiercely at the major, who was disregarding rank and acting insubordinately.

If it were another officer, they would have crushed the spirit with discipline or punishment, or at least with reprimands. No, if it were another officer, they wouldn't have even dared to challenge the commander in the first place. There were plenty of young officers who couldn't even speak a word properly to him.


"This is something else."


In the middle of the documents the major was reviewing, there was a newspaper clipping placed rudely. As the content caught his eye, the commander realized that he had asked an unnecessary question.

"Let’s talk about releasing the child."


I felt that the child would not be able to handle that madman. In the worst case, I wondered if he would end up killing both the child and himself. Even if he could handle it, I had a bad feeling that if the two were brought together, a disaster would occur. So, even if I explained that I was just trying to keep them apart, Winston would not be convinced.



As expected, the blind madman glared at him and bared his teeth.


"Your hand should be nothing, Grace, you need to let go of that side."


"Major, as I said last time, don't let go of everything you have just because of one thing you lost."


하나라니.


Leon clenched his fist until it hurt.


What was lost was everything to him.


But it's only one.


He took a deep breath and barely suppressed the rising anger.


"You seem to be mistaken; I am not the one who will lose everything because of your daughter."


"Again, I have no intention of killing that kid, whether he knows my secret or not."


"Whether you kill or steal it, it makes no difference to me."


The commander let out a weary sigh. Winston's obsession and madness towards that child grew deeper with each passing day. If it was already like this after just four months, it was impossible to foresee what would happen in the future.



Others did not dream of this madman and envied him. Every time I hear praise for his excellent judgment in selecting Winston and giving him command of the purge operation, no one knows how much I itch to tell the truth.

I roughly wiped my face and found a photo in front of me.


"This is…."


It was a photo of an identification card. An identification card with the name Nora Watson written on it, in other words, the fake identification that Angela Lee used when she infiltrated under him.

“Major.”


Campbell knocked on the door of the office.


"Come in."


In Campbell's hand was a note. The moment Leon realized what the note was about, he had no choice but to sit back down.



"We received a contact from Wakefield."


It meant that the detective he hired to track the woman had found something.


[Early to mid-March, 15 nights. Long-term stay alone. Fraser Hotel. Black hair. No visitors. Appeared healthy. Pregnant. Checked out voluntarily. Did not mention any destination afterwards. No record of stay at other hotels in the Wakefield area afterwards.]



What was written in the memo wasn't a decisive clue, but it did help to loosen the stiff tension in Leon's nape.


At least we confirmed that they're safe.


The ability to narrow down the tracking area to the Wakefield region in the south-central part of the country was thanks to the gold bars. In early March, Jonathan Riddle Jr. checked the serial numbers of the gold bars he had sold in the surveillance records and issued a wanted notice for gold bars with serial numbers close to those, at every place that purchases gold.



And a week ago, I confirmed that his reasoning was correct. A pregnant woman wearing sunglasses reported that she sold two 1 troy ounce gold bars at a bank in Wakefield on March 7.

Although it took some time for the report to come in, it was a satisfactory harvest just to fill the void of absence that had been left vacant for several months.

She sold two gold bars. Leon inferred that the purpose was either for rent or childbirth expenses. Whichever it was, it meant that Grace was planning to have a child in Wakefield.

"Please continue to keep an eye on the hospital and the midwife."


"Yes, I have already given that instruction."


"Alright. Let's go out."


As soon as we received the tip from the bank, we issued a concentrated alert to hospitals and midwives in Wakefield and the surrounding areas. Of course, there was always the possibility that the prediction could be wrong. Therefore, we also distributed flyers to hospitals and midwives across the country.

Although his gaze was not visible, his emotions could be fully felt through his poignant voice alone. It was utterly repulsive.



"No, it's beautiful."


The man whispered as he kissed the forehead of the whimpering baby. Grace, who had been staring blankly at the scene, clenched her trembling fists.

Why. Why. In my completely white mind, the same words kept repeating.


I did everything I could to avoid being caught by that man. About a month or two ago, I found a suitable apartment to hide in. As soon as I did, I filled the place with his belongings to make it look like my husband was just temporarily absent if anyone came in.



Of course, it was an effort to deceive the midwife. Yesterday afternoon, after being overdue by four days, the labor finally began, and when the scheduled midwife arrived, my husband conveniently pretended to be on a business trip.



They deliberately closed the curtains to darken the room. The lighting used only bulbs with a strong red glow, making the pupils appear a color other than turquoise.

Sampa seemed to have no doubts at all. He merely felt pity for Grace, who was giving birth alone, and for the 'husband' who missed the birth of the child.

But why did this happen?


Did the shaman finally recognize me and report it? At the moment of despair, the man who was cradling the baby suddenly burst into laughter.

“As long as you don’t resemble me… What did I say? Such wishes shouldn’t be made carelessly.”


He stroked the child's hair with a satisfied smile, completely ignoring Grace, who was glaring at him.


"Still, it's really good for you. At least they liked my appearance. I just hope you don't inherit my personality."


It's none of my business! I'm going to leave this place. Leaving behind all my past. Of course, there are you and your child there.



I wanted to shout, but my voice wouldn't come out.


"By the way, the crib fits better in the torture chamber than I expected."


Torture room? Startled by those words, Grace finally tore her gaze away from the man and looked around. A black ceiling, black walls, shackles and handcuffs gaping wide, embedded in them, and a metal table that glinted sharply as it caught the light at the corners.

"It's about time to be hungry."


Grace went to the kitchen and mixed a little formula in a bottle. Without getting tired, she took the crying baby out of the crib and went to the comfortable chair in front of the window. Instead of holding the baby, she laid him on her thigh and gently lifted his head to give him the bottle.


“No… why is that? What’s the problem?”


The child didn't suck on the nipple even when given a bottle; instead, they spat it out. Perhaps because they were hungry and frustrated, they thrashed around, flailing their hands, and cried until their face turned bright red.

“Sure, sorry for giving it to you late. Stop being irritated and eat, okay?”


I thought maybe if she stopped crying for a bit, I could feed her, so I put away the bottle and held her close to comfort her, but it was of no use. After struggling for a while, she attempted something she really didn’t want to do with a sense of resignation.



"Ha... You are really funny."


As soon as Grace bit the tip of my chest, she looked down at the subdued baby and let out a sigh of resignation.


"It's not coming out..."


Last night, I felt the midwife's gaze and forced the baby to latch. However, not much breast milk was produced, and

the feeling of breastfeeding wasn't very pleasant. So, to make it better for both of us, I prepared formula instead....


"It's already difficult."


A faint sound of waves could be heard from behind, and in her arms, there was the sound of a small mouth vigorously sucking on the breast. Grace, who was observing the baby with a stare, let out a long sigh.

“Why is it so small?”


Compared to the weight that had pressed down on her in her belly, the baby was so small and light.


Grace clung to me and embraced the small life that was sucking her milk with a bit more affection.


"You must have no sin."


Being born is not a sin. Birth always happens by the will of others.


If there is a sin, it would be with the man who created this child for selfish purposes, with me who was caught after becoming involved in a crime from the beginning, and with those who deceived her and led her to participate in the crime.

The only one who knew the wise answer was Grace.


I will personally find someone who will be a good parent.


Even if the child's eyes change to teal, it won't be easy for that man, whether he is a soldier or a rebel, to find the hidden child in one of the countless homes in this kingdom. And the child may live a life loved in an ordinary family, unaware throughout their life of the truth that they are the product of hatred and schemes.


Maybe.


At least it will be better than the other way.


Grace repeated the same words, comforting the child in her arms.


"This is the best."


The man in her head criticized Grace as if she were trying to persuade someone.


"You already know my plan."


Shut up. You should be unhappy.










A corpse lay on the cold metal table. Although the entire body was covered with a white cloth and not visible, it was clear from the build and the faintly discernible outline that it was a woman.

As the men surrounding the corpse fell into silence, a person who appeared to be a staff member of the morgue broke the uncomfortable stillness.

"This is the mother who died of postpartum fever today. Since she came to the hospital alone and there seems to be no husband or family, we contacted you as her description matches that on the missing persons flyer..."

The employee trailed off mid-explanation. Once again, an uncomfortable silence ensued. Leon, who briefly scanned the body wrapped in white cloth, grimaced as soon as he lifted his head. Both the staff at the morgue and Campbell wore grim expressions, as if they were doctors coming to deliver a terminal diagnosis to him.


Why are you making that face already before even seeing it?


He snorted and nodded at the staff. It was an instruction to remove the cloth covering his face, but the staff hesitated and glanced at him with a look of pity.

Is there really such a cold fire in the world?


I know well that there are people in the world who are this cold.


Dead person.


At that moment, Leon was crushed by a reality he could no longer deny. He despaired as he embraced Grace's lifeless body.



Even though her heart was always cold towards him, the woman whose body had been hot has now grown cold as well. How painful it is to realize that this woman no longer pushes him away. It was unbearably tormenting to know that Grace's cheeks were getting wet solely because of him.


"Why are you in a place like this?"


I hoped to find her desperately at every moment, but I never imagined I would find her in a place like this.


“If you had come to me, this wouldn't have happened.”


As soon as he blamed Grace out of habit, he collapsed once again.


I am the one who drove you to a miserable death. It is also my fault that I missed the chance to ask for your forgiveness and to make amends for the many wrongs I committed, as well as that we ultimately ended up in tragedy.



"I'm sorry."


A heartfelt apology that cannot reach someone is completely useless. At the end of reflection and apology, he shamelessly hoped such words would be waiting for him along with forgiveness.

Don't do that from now on.


However, there is no next for the two of them now. This was the end here.


"Grace."


Leon stroked her cold cheek, gazing into her eyes as he called the woman's name over and over again. Completely removing the hate, filled only with affection. For the first time. Only after taking his last breath.

"Grace...."



Thus, even until the last moment, the things to regret only continued to increase.
"Yes, please come in."


A voice was heard from inside. When I opened the door, a middle-aged man sitting at a desk in one corner of the room stood up. There were several stacks of cards lined up on the desk, as if he had been playing solitaire.

“Did you come after receiving a call?”


The staff in the morgue pointed to the cork board on one wall. Among various notices and rules, in the corner, a missing person flyer had been hanging for months, fading with time. Perhaps today that flyer might disappear. The staff couldn't easily define whether that would be a happy or sad event.


"Yes, that's correct."


As a man with dark blonde hair, appearing to be in his mid-20s, responded, the employee walked around the desk towards the body storage.

"I see from the phone number that it's from the west, so it seems you rushed over as soon as you received the call."


It was a 5-hour train ride from Winsford. I thought it would come the next day, but seeing it came rushing right away, it seems there was quite a longing.

It was a moment that tugged at the heart. The young man opened the door wide and stepped inside, then moved aside, as if to make way for someone.

The person looking for a woman was not that young man.


The moment the tall young gentleman stepped inside, his eyes widened in surprise. From his neat appearance to his luxurious suit, the man looked very wealthy at first glance.

The dead woman seemed to be poor. Could she be a runaway government official? The middle-aged man blinked blankly, making a tired guess.

The young gentleman stood in the middle of the mortuary. He was wearing sunglasses, so his eyes were not clearly visible, but it felt as if he was casting his gaze on each of the tightly closed doors of the corpse storage, as if searching for a missing woman.



"This way."


The employee guided the man to the left. As he unlocked the mechanism of the 2B compartment, he nervously chewed on his parched lips.

What if it’s right?


The deceased missing person was a tragedy whether found or not. There was an air of tension in the morgue, as if everyone shared the same thought. Even the tall man who appeared calm seemed tense, as indicated by the slight

"Yes, that can't be."


The major, with his thin hands that made his blue veins prominent, extinguished the cigar and wore a precarious smile.



I immediately got into the waiting taxi and headed back to the train station. It took six hours to get here, but I will have stayed for less than 20 minutes.

In the back seat of the taxi, Leon pressed his hand against his forehead with his eyes gently closed.


This was already the third time.


As the due date approached, I waited for the tip to come in. But the phone did not ring.


In the meantime, time had flown by. Unable to wait any longer, Leon expanded the search order. From hospitals and birthing centers to the morgue. It might be that the child was born but something went wrong. After that, the ringing of the phone was no longer unconditionally welcome.


So, this means that stepping forward and then hesitating to step back in front of the cliff is the third time. So what should I do when the day comes that I can no longer step back?

As the gunfire in the nightmare echoed in his ears, Leon quietly swallowed a sigh.


As soon as I arrived at the train station, I boarded the night train back to Winsford. On the opposite platform, the night train to the south was standing. The inside of the train, visible through the open doors and windows, was already filled with a party atmosphere. However, the train heading west, which was generally far from summer vacation, was extremely quiet.



Leon, who boarded the train, opened the door to the first-class sleeper and gestured to Campbell to come over.


"Take a break now."


"Yes, Major..."


After she disappeared, Campbell hesitated every time he greeted someone. He didn’t know what to say. There was no longer a good night or a peaceful night for him.

“…Please get plenty of rest for tomorrow.”


Nodding his head, Leon entered the cabin and leaned his body against the closed door, pressing his hand against his aching forehead.



Thinking about tomorrow.



He laughed. It was a quiet laugh that sounded like a sob.
"Are you unhappy?"


Yeah. So are you happy?


No, are you alive?


But the woman only repeated the same words instead of answering.


Are you unhappy?










“Haam….”


The child burst into laughter, finding the sound of yawning amusing.


"It's not playtime. Eat quickly."


“Ha… Ugh….”


In this early morning, you wake someone up saying you’re hungry, but instead of eating, you just play around.

Grace forced the child, who began to babble, to latch onto her breast.


As the child quietly began to breastfeed, I hurriedly continued calculating the money that I had been doing before.

The cash was slowly running low.


"Do I have to sell gold again?"


Grace cast her gaze towards the wardrobe. Inside that safe was all her wealth. The diamonds were unchanged, but the gold bars had decreased by three.

"Should I ask the broker if they want to buy again?"


Two of the gold bars were sold at the bank, but the last one was sold to the real estate agent who introduced me to this apartment. In fact, it was more of a unique transaction than a sale.

"Ah, is there a place nearby where I can get a good price for gold? Whether it’s a bank, a jeweler, or even a pawn shop would be fine."




As I was about to sign the contract, I suddenly thought of asking the broker for recommendations for shops or good
Grace, who had flipped through the newspaper directly to the classified ads, suddenly frowned as she scanned the page for an advertisement seeking a child for adoption.

[To Daisy, your nephews want to see you. From your brother.]


That man was still running this nauseating advertisement.


"You're just scattering money around carelessly."


It meant that Winston was holding Joe and his family hostage, but Grace didn't flinch. Joe was not a soft, pliable person like Jimmy. So he would handle it well on his own.

Moreover, the man must know that if he harms Joo's family, it will be the end with Grace forever.


"The penthouses are overflowing, yet take good care of my nephews, you idiot, ah!"


While she was watching the ad with her head down and smirking, something suddenly flew in and hit Grace's nose.

Her startled fist returned to her chest as if nothing had happened.


"Oh, it really hurts."


Grace groaned while rubbing her nose. Even in her belly, there was so much kicking and punching going on.


“Why is an 8-week-old baby so strong?”


I laughed in disbelief, and the baby, with the nipple in its mouth, opened its mouth wide and laughed along.


"Everything is beautiful."


Grace's smile withered in an instant.


I held the baby who was starting to doze off from being full and gave him a pat on the back. Throughout this, the baby clung to Grace's body with his tiny arms. At times like this, I couldn't help but feel heavy-hearted, as if I knew she was thinking of leaving me.



"It's okay. There are better things in the world than me..."


The word "mom" lingered on my tongue.



“…There are many people. This is a better path for you.”
"Is there no volunteer?"


No one answered. There is no one who wants to be executed by shooting voluntarily.


As the mockery of the devil reaches its peak, those who are all too familiar with what happens next visibly begin to tremble.



Among them, two people did not tremble. They already knew that they would not die today. Nevertheless, their faces were clearly tense. This was because they were doomed to be bound to the pole at the end of the execution site, having witnessed the deaths of all their comrades.


"Is there no volunteer? This is…."


Just over a month ago, there were 8 people gathered at the site. However, now only five remain. This means that one of the three gathered here today is destined to die.

From late spring onwards, Winston became increasingly cruel. Previously, he had seen through the author how far human cruelty could go, but now it felt as if cruelty itself, wearing the shell of humanity, was playing with lesser beings.



Jimmy had a hunch. This is a venting of anger. It’s not a venting of the anger for what we’ve done, but rather a venting of the anger for what someone else has done to the author onto us. It was clear that that someone else was Grace.



Because of Grace's mistake, I have to be wrongfully sacrificed. Clenching my teeth while trembling bit by bit and holding back my anger, Winston, who had been mockingly pacing back and forth, suddenly stopped upright.

"Then there's nothing we can do."


Last time, we decided on the execution target through a drawing. I wonder what kind of crazy act they are planning to draw this time. Everyone was holding their breath, swallowing dry saliva.

"Tell me why someone else should die instead of you. The two who succeed in convincing me will be spared."


Except for Little Jimmy and David Wilkins, the three looked up suddenly and exchanged glances filled with clear surprise. Soon, instead of bewilderment, their eyes began to show signs of hesitation, and the moment one of them opened their mouth, everything changed.



"Sir, Lieutenant, those two of us previously…."


Ultimately, the ugly expose has begun.


"Lee, I have betrayed my comrades for a man, saying that I was obsessed with them..."



"Stop it!"
"Can't do it? Anyway, what does it mean to do it right? Alright, today I'll choose especially."


Though I acted as if it was inevitable that I would choose, Leon had actually predetermined the target of execution. After relentlessly observing the actions of three death row inmates as they were pushed into various crises, the person he chose was neither the one who desperately tried to survive first nor the one who bravely stepped forward to die first.



"The most indecisive person who could neither betray first nor give up first."


As Leon pointed at a prisoner with the tip of his whip, the man distorted his face and trembled.


"I dislike indecisive people."


The attitude of not wanting to take risks, cowardly and lacking courage, is just detestable. Leon, who had been reciting the reasons for choosing today's death row inmate, suddenly stopped.

“Wait, who is this?”


He marveled as if he recognized the face of a dear acquaintance, opening his arms wide.


"Despite being so indecisive, it was the first one to bring up the notion of granting Grace an honorable death."


He became even more contemplative and turned to look at his comrades with eyes full of resentment. This means that someone who was present at that time said it all.

"That's not me giving the orders…. Hey, everyone thought that way! Right! Tell them, everyone!"


But the comrades either turned a blind eye or just watched Leon's expression.


"Please just spare my life."


Leon leaned over the man crawling on the dirt floor, facing imminent death. The whip tip pushed up his chin.


"Oh, could you not have swallowed cyanide and died with honor? Then today's disgraceful death could have been avoided."



"Please, I was wrong."


“I now understand why you raised that woman. It’s amazing. You who held the Joker but didn’t know how to use it, ended up being the fools who fell victim to that Joker.”


Leon clicked his tongue and stood up straight.
"God, please look down upon that poor child."


"I'm curious if you pray like that for my father as well."


Only then did he realize the reason for his visit, and he turned pale as a sheet.


"I'm disappointed. If I had known you were the enemy who killed my father, I wouldn't have let Fred go so easily. At the very least, I would have killed him in front of you."

He then cowardly came out, as if sensing that he would die more painfully than his son.


“I truly apologize for Lieutenant Richard Winston’s matter. That was never my intention.”


"I find it unpleasant that you think this can be smoothed over with an apology."


"That's not it..."


"Life for life."


At his words, the guy started to tremble his hands.


"Ah, so you've already done that to Fred…"


"Oh, so you paid with your child's life instead of your own? What a… Fred, did you just hear what your father said?"


Leon mocked Fred in hell, asking towards the prison floor.


“Fine. If you want to save your life using your child's life, then go ahead.”


Watching the spark of hope ignite in his opponent's eyes only to be extinguished immediately was Leon's favorite pastime.



"You won't kill me right away. You will bring each of my children one by one and kill them in front of me before you can rid yourself of all this resentment and send me off with a light heart. Come to think of it, you seem to have quite a few children. Including the runaway Nancy. In other words, you’re saying you’ll keep me alive until you catch that woman and kill her. It must be rewarding to stay alive thanks to your children."


And Leon has faithfully kept that promise to this day.



"Angie! That guy is an accomplice too!"
The sound of footsteps trudging across the dry earth slowly crossed the scene. The man, who was sobbing from an indescribable pain spreading from his thigh to his whole body, opened his eyes when the footsteps stopped in front of him and a presence was felt.



At that moment, he regretted that he was still alive.


"Huh!"


The thick end of the whip burrowed into the wound. Camden's vampire bared its white teeth fiercely, as if to bite his neck, and asked him.



"What did you say?"


"Ugh!"


The man rolled his eyes back in extreme pain, his whites visible, and gasped for breath.


"I asked who just called someone a whore."


Winston grabbed his chin with his gloved hand, forcing him to meet his gaze, and then spat it out word by word.


"Grace is a saint."


The cool voice sent shivers down my spine.


"Don't forget even in hell. My woman is a saint."


The moment the whip withdrew, the man gasped for breath. He hoped it would be his last breath, but the god of execution knew no mercy.



"Let me die like this."


“Please, please kill me…”


Leon leisurely wiped the dirt off his shoes with a handkerchief, as if he were appreciating a scream as sweet music.

In front of the four pale little mice, the dirty handkerchief and the command were presented.


"Make sure to watch until the end."


The fate of those who dare to insult my woman.



He stepped outside the execution ground, biting his teeth in a silent mantra.
When thinking rationally, it was not a bad choice. There are many villas along the coast, making it easier to find short-term rental apartments for about six months compared to other areas. Moreover, since it's a summer tourist destination, no one would think it strange to always wear sunglasses. It's a place frequented by outsiders, so there is less concern for others.



And there was no place better than Abington Beach to exploit the man's mistake. He would certainly expect that she wouldn't hide at Abington Beach, where remnants of emotion, whether guilt or something else, lingered. So using that incident to inversely hide at Abington Beach was also a good idea.


But in the end, it didn't happen that way. As the man had expected, the lingering emotions made me uncomfortable even at the mere mention of Abingdon Beach.

So in the end, we settled in a place about 20 minutes away from Abington Beach by tram.


Since then, even if I had to go out, I never came this way, but today I had no choice. The family who said they would take the child lived at the end of this train line.

She could have just come and asked to take the child. Usually, that's how adoptions seemed to go. But Grace chose to go herself this hot summer, carrying the heavy child. She wanted to see what kind of people and what kind of home it was.



"It's my duty to find you a good family."


Not knowing that this would be the eternal last moment, I quietly watched the child sleeping soundly as the tram continued to run past Abington Beach. Before long, the beach was out of sight, and the journey transitioned into a succession of small and large towns as it approached the outskirts of a big city.


"New Haven. The next station is New Haven."


It was the place where Grace had to get off. She cradled the child, still fast asleep, as the sound of the streetcar was like a lullaby.



"Ugh... It's heavy."


As the child approached three months, their weight and size rapidly increased like a snowball rolling down a hill.

Although a stroller was essential to carry such a heavy child, I didn't buy one.


I’ll send it soon, what about the stroller?


I wrapped the large shawl I had taken off because of the heat around myself and the child. The child, disturbed from a honeyed sleep, began to frown and whimper.

"You are too tired. I will really send it this week."


Grace let out a deep sigh while calming the fussy baby as she walked into the residential area after getting off the tram.

Without realizing it, I kissed the child's forehead, and this time the child burst into a giggle. Grace paused for a moment, then pretended nothing had happened and pulled her lips away, gently urging the child once again.

"I'm smiling like this even inside."


Grace pushed up her sunglasses, which kept slipping down her nose due to the beads of sweat, and looked around the living room. It was a quite neat and stylish house, just as nice inside as it was outside.

"It must have been tough to come all the way here carrying a child in this heat. You must be thirsty, so please don't hesitate and drink."



The woman sitting across from Grace at the coffee table poured iced tea from a crystal jug into a tall glass.


"Thank you."


Grace sipped her refreshing iced tea and looked over the table this time. In the corner of the long mahogany table was a telephone, next to which was a neatly stacked pile of department store catalogs.

In fact, one could tell that a wealthy family was evident just by looking at the ice in the glass held in their hand.


"It seems that there is a refrigerator at home."


There is an expensive item in the house that requires selling two gold bars to afford. Furthermore, when I came in, I saw a new sedan parked in front of the garage. So, in terms of wealth, it was already a success.

In fact, other things already seemed to be passed.


The excited voices of two boys playing with a large dog in the backyard occasionally drifted through the half-open window.



"Try this as well."


The woman clearly cut the cherry tart that she must have baked herself and gave it to Grace. Then, when she handed a piece to her husband sitting next to her, the man received the dessert plate and gave his wife a light kiss on the cheek.



The presence of a stranger in front of him did not seem to bother him, indicating it was a habit ingrained in him for a long time. The man in his late thirties, with his arm casually draped around the beautiful woman's shoulders, appeared successful both socially and domestically at first glance.


In a word, it was an ideal middle-class household that could appear in an advertisement.


You chose well.



Grace imagined the child sitting on her lap, looking around, becoming a member of this perfect family. In other
The man looking down at the child seemed to read Grace's thoughts, and then he glanced at her. He hesitated as if about to say something, then immediately closed his mouth and scratched the back of his head, looking somewhat embarrassed.



Grace seemed to understand what she was trying to say. Lately, she hadn't had the time to dye her hair again, and it had returned to its original dark brown color.

So it's only natural that such thoughts would arise.


The child's dad is blonde.


The reason the man couldn't finish that trivial remark was because of the false excuse Grace gave.


During the pregnancy, my husband passed away in an accident. I want to raise the child, but I already have two kids, and I cannot afford to do it alone. So I am considering sending this child away. That was Grace's unfortunate story.



“How can you be this pretty?”


The woman looked down at Grace's child with eyes already in love. For some reason, a bitter taste lingered in her mouth, which she washed away with iced tea, and she forced a smile.

Yes, it's better for that child to have a mom who looks at them with those eyes.


The woman, tickling the child's belly and playing, looked at Grace with a face that expressed how she didn't know what to do with her love.



"To be honest, I've seen a lot of children while looking into adoption. But this is the first time I've seen such a doll-like baby."



"When she grows up, she will be an incredible beauty."


"That's only natural because Mom is an incredible beauty."


The woman, as a mother herself, felt a bit sorry for Grace and put on a sympathetic face as she encouraged her.

Grace smiled as if nothing was wrong but inwardly lamented.


Actually, it's because the child's dad is an incredible beauty.


The child looked just like that man in every way. From his hair to the shape of his face, even his demeanor, he resembled her father. The man she despised the most.


If that's the case, I wish my eyes resembled that man’s.
“Shall we go see your room, baby?”


The woman stood up from the sofa and took the child from her husband. Then, without hesitation, she headed for the stairs.



Is it time for me to let you go now?


It was when I was sitting idly, staring at the distant figure receding. I locked eyes with a child who was looking around with the woman’s shoulders between us. Perhaps my expectation of them looking for her was correct, as the child’s face crumpled up, and then they reached out their hand towards Grace and burst into tears.


In that moment, Grace's heart began to race.


"Baby, what's wrong? Are you feeling uncomfortable?"


The woman, after much effort to comfort the child, finally realized what the child wanted. In the moment of handing over and receiving the child, the emotions of the two women flipped. As expected, the child stopped crying the moment he was held by Grace.



I wiped away the tears that were hanging on the baby's eyes and gave back the pacifier that had fallen out from crying. The baby clutched Grace's collar tightly with her small hand even after the tears had dried, pouting her ugly little lips and whimpering. Grace gently patted the baby's back and quietly comforted her.


"You shouldn't cry. Why did you cry? Huh?"


It was a voice far removed from scolding.


"The baby seems to already recognize her mother."


The woman standing at a distance murmured in a bitter voice as she watched the mother and daughter. Grace tried to appear polite with a bitter smile on her face, but she could not help feeling a sense of pride inside.

It was a foolish act.


At the same time, it was an utterly foolish act to speak harshly to the child.


"Don't smile at me. Get attached."


On the way back, I eventually got off the tram midway.


Thirsty. No one asked such a flimsy excuse, yet Grace spoke to herself and headed towards the beach across the road.




The convenience store was still there. However, in the place where the grumpy man used to stand, there was a
Sitting on a bench by the roadside and gazing at the sea, I eventually reached a point where I was thirsty.


"Uh... why do I drink if I'm just writing...."


As soon as Grace poured herself a glass of sparkling water and took a sip, she grimaced. The baby sitting on her lap looked at her face with a curious expression, then stared intently at the light blue sparkling water bottle.

"Why? Do you want to try drinking too?"


I placed the nozzle of the bottle to the tiny lips and let a little bit of sparkling water trickle in, and the baby immediately curled up and scrunched up his face. It seemed the taste was not to his liking.

"Ugh-."


"Right? I drink this tasteless stuff every day, you know? I really can't understand this person."


Grace's face, which had been wiping the carbonated water spat out by the baby with a bib and talking and laughing to herself, suddenly stiffened.

“It is not good education to speak ill of your father in front of your child.”


Shut up. Please, I mean shut up.


These days, that man has been speaking to her in her mind all day long. Since being trapped in the annex, he has been the only person she could communicate with. Even after escaping, she had lived in isolation, never having a proper conversation with anyone else.



So, for the past year and four months, Grace's only conversation partner has been that man.


Even if I wanted to talk, there was no one to talk to, so I often found myself exchanging conversations with that man in my head, only to be startled and stop. But that man, even in my head, was incredibly persistent.

"Grace Riddle."


Why.


"Have you ever imagined a life that isn't yours?"


Yeah, now I'm going to live a life that's not like the Gracies. Normally. Normally like those people.


Grace stared intently at a young couple standing side by side, each holding the hands of a baby walking unsteadily on the sand beach dyed red by the sunset.

Grace murmured as she held the child who was snuggling into her arms, possibly feeling drowsy.


If you just send me away, I will leave.










Despite it being November, on the border of autumn and winter, the south felt warm enough for a thick trench coat.

As I opened the window, a cool and humid breeze poured into the taxi, carrying the scent of the sea.


The taxi that had left the vicinity of the train station began to race down the road that separates the shopping district from the beach. During the peak season, this area buzzes with activity past midnight, but now, in the off-season, it was almost desolate.



León, who had been gazing out the window with sunken eyes, lifted his head as the entrance of the carnival passed before him. Soon, the giant Ferris wheel towering against the black sky came into view.

You're still in that place.


The scene, halted with all the lights turned off, felt as if time had stopped forever. In that moment of that time.


Memories might be something like that. Like a closed carnival, they lie asleep with the lights off, and in the moment we seek them, the lights turn on and they come back to life.

It was the moment when the switch of memories clicked on.


The boy sitting at the top of the Ferris wheel, kissing the girl, suddenly turned his head this way and glared at him with resentful eyes. A silent scream soon echoed in his ears.

Fool.


You told me to say what I don't know.


Leaning his arm against the window and resting his face on his hand, the taxi came to a stop in front of a building made of white brick after going over a couple of hills. Leon put on the sunglasses that he had tucked into the front pocket of his suit jacket.



"You should be here."


He left Pierce in the taxi and headed to the entrance of the building with Campbell. As soon as Campbell pressed the bell at the main gate, the door opened and a middle-aged man gave the two of them an anxious smile.


"Mr. Hopper?"
Since then, the apartment has remained empty and has not been contracted.


Leon had to suppress his anger once again. If the contract had only been extended, at this moment he would have found Grace and the child, bringing the year-long pursuit to an end.

Still, it wasn't just despair. The six months of suffering had come to an end. Both Grace and the child were alive. It was no exaggeration to say that the past six months had been spent just to find out that one thing.

"Did the woman live alone?"


"As far as I know, that's correct."


"Did you take the child with you when you left?"


The broker nodded with a look that seemed to say he didn't understand why such an obvious question was being asked.



“Ha….”


I found out one more thing. Grace did not abandon his child. The fact that I could almost miss that woman again and still laugh was thanks to that.

Indeed, the lonely woman cannot abandon the child who is no different from herself. Even if she runs away from him, she will drag the shackles of the child along the ground, and as time passes, those shackles will become heavier. In the end, she will surely be caught.



Leon saw hope in despair.


"I don't know where they went."


"I don't know about that. I was told that Mrs. Baker changed her mind after I offered to introduce her to another house nearby."



I wonder where it went.


I know the final destination. I plan to go to my aunt in Columbia. I regularly check the entry and exit offices of all ports, but there have been no reports of the wanted woman appearing yet.

That woman, when on earth is she planning to leave? Leon recalled the words of the doctor who had come to the annex for a check-up around last Christmas. Now it had been 6 months since the birth, surpassing the 4 months the doctor had mentioned. That meant it was a time when she could take a long-distance trip by boat.



Is the time nearing for that woman to get caught in the trap?
A strange emotion welled up inside my chest. What felt like a tingling thrill soon transformed into a whip that struck my heart harshly.



“Ha….”


The emotion twisted and tightened around my heart, squeezing it to the point of pain. It should have hurt, yet laughter kept bubbling up uncontrollably. It wasn't bad.

Leon closed his eyes and imagined.


What would the child of Grace and me look like?


It's good for a child to resemble the woman he loves, but Leon imagined a child who resembles him completely.

Grace is sitting propped up against this bed. In her arms, a child who has inherited his appearance is sound asleep.


A strange joy was felt.


How could that woman not be able to separate that being from her embrace? Perhaps the love for the child is growing in Grace's heart, sowing the seeds of love for him. It felt like a cowardly hope was sprouting.

Leon, submerged under the sweet yet bitter surface of his imagination, opened his eyes wide at the faint sound that could be heard.



It’s a wave.


I approached the window and drew back the curtains. Beyond the buildings across the street, the dark blue sea was visible. And beyond that, in a distant place, hills with sporadic lights appeared faintly above the thick mist.

It was a villa area of Abington Beach.


Amidst the multitude of emotions surging and intertwining in an instant, he recalled a question that he did not know where to cast.



Grace, what were you thinking while raising our child in the house where we first met?


Perhaps she had no thoughts at all. The woman simply judged with her head and chose this place among so many in this vast kingdom. Rational, logical, and reasonable reasons raised their voices and crushed his pathetic expectations.



How long had I been sitting at the edge of the bed, staring blankly at the empty crib? I heard the sound of someone clearing their throat behind me.


"Um, Your Excellency…."
I stopped in front of the third building. The family crest of the count was very graciously embedded in bronze on the iron fence surrounding the backyard of the building.

There were no lit windows, indicating that everyone was still asleep. Grace carefully opened the gate and pushed the stroller inside. She parked the stroller in front of the stairs to the employee-only entrance and opened the handbag she was holding on her arm.



The object that Grace took out sparkled brilliantly even in the dim dawn light. However, the gaze with which she looked at it only blurred.



"You... what on earth...."


The question I had when I first saw this ring has not faded away; instead, it has continued to torment Grace up to this moment.



‘What on earth were you thinking to do this to me….’


I realized it late. Inside the ring, two names were engraved side by side. One was Leon, and the other was Grace.


Not Daisy, but Grace.


You wouldn't do that....


Grace was absentmindedly fiddling with the engraving when she suddenly snapped to attention at the sound of the bell announcing 5 AM from a distant church.

What are you doing? There's no time for this.


The train to the south was scheduled to depart from the central station in about 40 minutes. Grace took a letter from her bag, put the ring inside, and sealed it. Then she climbed the stairs and pushed the envelope into the mailbox next to the entrance door.



Thud. The sound of a heavy envelope dropping into the mailbox made my heart skip a beat for a moment.


She immediately came down the stairs and took out a rectangular brown bag from the lower shelf of the stroller, placing it on the frosty stone floor.

Then I looked into the stroller. The child was sound asleep, covered with a pure white, fluffy blanket. When he slept, he truly was like an angel.

"Kind."


On the way, they didn't whine or break down. It's only natural, as the child was particularly good at sleeping in the stroller. I had so much trouble pushing the stroller every night to put this child, who has long sleep protests, to bed.

Grace, unable to take her eyes off the stroller left alone in the middle of the yard until she reached the back door, took a deep breath as if to suppress something. Then she suddenly turned around and ran outside.

The sound of footsteps echoed in the empty alley. Only the footsteps echoed.


I'm sorry. Live well.


I will live my life. You live your life too.


The sharp razor glided smoothly along the jawline. The barber's skill was so excellent that he handled the blade flawlessly even on a shaking train.

León, comfortably leaning back in his chair, turned his gaze out the window while the barber went to get a towel to wipe off the shaving cream. The sky had brightened a bit compared to just a moment ago, as dawn slowly approached. He rolled up his sleeve to check his wristwatch. There was about 20 minutes left until he arrived at the central station of the royal road.



What should I do in the meantime?


Was it thanks to the harvest of last night? Because he hadn’t had a nightmare in a long time, Leon was able to clear his mind and go over what he needed to do from now on.

What he wanted to do right now was to make a phone call. But it was also the most useless thing to do. The sun hadn't risen yet, so Campbell couldn't have obtained new information overnight.

Then I thought about going to the restaurant area, but I changed my mind.


Breakfast was to be held at the townhouse. In the morning, there would be a brief rest while reviewing the agenda items for today's vote. There was a lunch appointment with other members. Then, it was destined to be stuck in the council all afternoon.



He gazed at the distant horizon, brightening before him, and let out a low groan in discontent as he rested his forehead on one hand. Despite the fatigue being apparent, weariness suddenly washed over him.

"I'm already bored."


Leon believed that a tedious day awaited him.


The train station, where the departure time of the first train was approaching, was quite bustling compared to the streets. Grace, who had entered in a daze, noticed the clock hanging on the wall and headed toward the ticket booth. Having lightened her load, her steps should have been light, but they felt heavy instead.


I bought a third-class ticket for the ferry departing for Newport. She stopped in front of the phone booth as she was heading straight to the platform.

Her gaze, effortfully lifting the corners of her mouth, did not leave the baby.


"Dorothy, you should greet them too. Good morning."


The woman shook the baby's hand as if greeting.


“…Hello, Dorothy. You are really beautiful.”


The child looking at her with a bewildered gaze appeared to be of a similar age to Grace's daughter.


No, that's not right. My daughter developed much faster, so that baby is probably around 7 or 8 months old.


The man sitting next to me took an apple out of his bag and handed it to his wife. Then the baby kept trying to snatch it away, wriggling its little hands.

My daughter often does such pretty things too.


Suddenly, at that moment of thought, Grace's heart sank.


My daughter...


What are you talking about? I don't have a daughter. Grace clenched her teeth and shut her eyes tightly. However, she couldn't block out the sound.

"Abba-."


The incessant babbling of the unfamiliar baby gradually transformed into a familiar voice in her mind.


“Abubu-.”


Just a few hours ago, it was around the time I had finally managed to fall asleep after tossing and turning all night. When I heard someone calling me and opened my eyes, I saw a child standing, holding onto the railing of the crib, bathed in the faint light of a streetlamp seeping through the curtains. It was the first time they had stood up by themselves.



“Ppuu-.”


The baby did not know the word "mom." So, when she wanted to call her, she would pucker her tiny mouth, smaller than a cherry bud, and awkwardly make a "pwoo" sound. That way, when she created and burst bubbles with her mouth, Grace would come running to wipe her mouth. She was smart enough to already know that making that sound was the best way to attract attention, rather than crying at the top of her lungs.



“Ah!”
"Uaaang!"


It was the moment when the baby sitting across from me burst into tears, startled by the loud noise.


"Black…."


Grace also burst into tears like a child. She opened her eyes wide, but tears blurred her vision, making it impossible to see anything.



Really, there was nothing visible anymore.


Grace hurriedly got up, roughly pulled out the bag she had placed under the seat, and pushed through the people standing in the aisle towards the door.

As I threw the door open wide and seemed to jump onto the platform, the train departed. People were surely looking at me as if I were a madwoman, but I didn't care. Grace ran frantically, pushing through the crowd that filled the platform.



Beep-.


As the miracle bell rang out long, a black locomotive entered the station, emitting steam from the opposite platform. When the night train from the south came to a stop, Grace was already outside the train station.

"Please hurry to the town house of Count Winston."


She hailed any taxi and yelled. The driver kept glancing at her as he drove, but Grace looked straight ahead with tears streaming down her face.

"Hurry, hurry please."


She kept fidgeting nervously and urging the article, and reason scolded her.


Grace, you need to leave all your past behind and live your life.


What is my life even about?


Grace has finally posed the most important question.


Whatever it is, it was clear that I could not fully live my life with only memories, solely memories, of that child.



She gritted her teeth with tears in her eyes.
Running around the fence towards the back door, Grace chanted the same words in a sobbing voice like a prayer. It felt like her heart was about to leap out of her mouth.

“Black….”


The moment she turned the corner and saw the canopy of the black stroller beyond the low bushes, Grace burst into a laughter that sounded like crying.

There is. It's still there.


There was no one in the backyard. Judging by the milk basket at the door being untouched, it seemed that no one had come out yet. Grace threw her suitcase outside the fence as if discarding it and ran inside.

"My daughter…."


She retracted the awning. As the peacefully sleeping angel baby caught Grace's eye, she could no longer hold back.


"I'm sorry, baby. Mom is sorry."


Before it was too late, I acknowledged with my own words that I was this child's mother. Only then did the heaviness that had long pressed down on her vanish, almost absurdly easily.

"Ee-ing-."


The sudden commotion woke the child from sleep. The child, who was stretching out both clenched fists and expressing annoyance, broke into a bright smile the moment their eyes met with mom, as if to say when did I complain? As Grace smiled wide, the tears that had been brimming in her eyes fell with a soft splash.


At that moment, Grace saw herself in her daughter. She had always held infinite and absolute affection for her mother. That appearance was only seen in a child who was merely six months old. When she received her mother's affection as a child, she would feel as if it were Christmas. This child, who smiles the happiest in the world just because her mom is right in front of her, must feel the same way.



You resemble me.


I kissed the child's cheek and whispered.


Grace pulled the stroller out beyond the fence. She placed the things she had thrown down onto the shelf and, pushing the stroller along the alley, asked me again.

So what is my life?


Grace decided the answer for herself by giving her daughter, who started sucking her thumb, the pacifier she had in her pocket.

What to look at first. The gaze that was scanning stopped at a letter envelope that had a strange shape at the corner. That suspicious envelope had no post office stamp.

Thud.


The moment the name Daisy Abington appeared, the coffee cup was roughly set down on the saucer. While Leon eagerly grabbed the letter and opened it, it felt as though time had stopped inside the restaurant. The employees serving were looking at him with surprised eyes, and the only thing that indicated the passage of time was the coffee stain spreading across the white tablecloth.



"Ha…."


Leon, who took the engagement ring out of the envelope, sighed. The fact that Grace had come here was good news, but returning the ring was bad news.

She knew that the woman was wanted for the ring. She probably didn't need the money, so there would have been no reason to sell it.



Losing a single clue to track Grace, he couldn't possibly feel the pain of a bullet piercing through his heart. Leon's gaze stayed fixated on the names engraved side by side on the inside of the ring.

This is a confirmation kill.


I don't need a future with you.


It seemed as if the woman's cry lingered in my ears.


Grace Lee was the only woman who could kill Leon Winston without a word.


He asked the flustered butler, who wasSuppressing the feeling of being abandoned again.


"This letter, when did it arrive?"


"I just took it out of the mailbox a moment ago."


"The last time I checked the mailbox was."


"It was around 6 PM yesterday evening."


Then the woman came back and forth here during those 12 hours. Is there any clue that can tell us the exact time? Leon unfolded the letter inside. The first sentence of the letter jumped straight into the main topic without any preamble.




[You raised the child you made, so take full responsibility for them, you bastard.]
Leon revisited his memories. On the shelf under the stroller, there was clearly a large suitcase. An object that had seemed insignificant a moment ago suddenly became a crucial clue.

You're trying to leave completely. So you must have been thinking of giving away the child you've been holding onto all this time.



It was obvious where they were trying to go. If you wanted to catch the passenger ship to Columbia, now was the last chance of the year. The only means of transportation from Wangdo to the harbor was by train.

Train station. Grace would have gone to the train station.


As Leon was about to go outside, he hurriedly turned around and gave instructions to the butler.


"Also call the security personnel."


The individuals responsible for his personal security gathered in the central hall in an instant.


"Find the young woman in her mid-to -late twenties with teal eyes and a red hat, who is either accompanying a black stroller or a baby around six months old, scattered across all train stations in the kingdom. It’s highly likely she will be taking a train south, so search thoroughly and inquire diligently. Right now."


Leon got into the waiting car as soon as he gave the order. His heart raced wildly as he scanned the outside, looking for the figure he had seen moments ago, while the car sped in the direction Grace had walked.

I saw Grace. Although I couldn't even see her face from a distance, Grace appeared before me nearly a year later.


Damn it. I should have trusted my instincts.


Even in regret, Leon felt a hint of joy.


Grace visited the child again. It was truly regrettable not to have seen the child, but it was a joyful thing that the woman could not let go of her child.

At least one of the countless wishes regarding Grace has come true according to his will.


León, who had been constantly looking out the window, suddenly narrowed his eyes sharply. But why did that woman go this way? If she goes in this direction, it won't lead to the central station. It's a road heading south, so one could speculate that she went to the southern station, but that only added to the questions instead of providing an answer.



What could be the reason for going to a distant place when there is a nearby central station?






She hugged the bewildered baby tightly and sobbed. As a look of distress crossed the employee's face, Grace poured out complaints that a middle-aged married woman would understand, disparaging a nonexistent husband.

"Do you know how lazy a husband can be when he hasn't even reported the birth of his daughter eight months after she was born?"



"Oh dear, men are really lazy about those things. Then when the beer runs out, they blame me for being lazy."


"Who drank all that beer, I wonder?"


"That's right, that's right."


“That man, I was completely deceived thinking that he had definitely registered his birth, until I found out yesterday.”



"There are even lies in the world..."


"I really don't know what kind of father exists in this world. Why did I marry that irresponsible man... No, my dear. Still, I'm glad to have met you."

The baby, with wide eyes as if asking why it's crying, awkwardly patted Grace's cheek with small hands. It seemed like the baby was trying to wipe away the tears, but due to poor control of strength, it felt more like being hit on the cheek.



“No, baby. Mom is okay.”


She patted the baby and looked at the staff with a pitying gaze. The expression of embarrassment that had been reflected on the woman's face had already turned to one of 'difficulty.' It meant they were almost there.

"Yesterday, there was such a fight at the boarding house that I even came here and sat outside from dawn, saying I would register our daughter... sob...."

"Oh dear. On a day like this, in this cold...."


The woman reached over the counter and patted the chubby baby bottom, lamenting the thick diaper, and muttered.



“Ah… I can register my marriage here, but originally I should bring my husband…”


"That man drank all night, so he must be snoring while he's sleeping now."


Grace, who had wiped her fake tears with the end of her sleeve, suddenly pretended to remember something and rummaged through her handbag to ask.

“…Elizabeth.”


It was an attitude that couldn't understand the reason for giving the name "Pihara," which is so common, to his one and only daughter.



That's the most common thing.


Grace naturally had a strong desire to give her daughter a beautiful and special name. However, even now, and likely in the New World as well, the two of them would still be pursued by that man. Although she was accustomed to living with a changed name, the child was not. If the name changed frequently, it would cause confusion, so she deliberately chose the most common name.



And I didn't want to lead a life with multiple names like I do.


"Well, if it pleases the child's mother."


Watching the employee issue the birth certificate, Grace couldn't help but chuckle at a sudden realization.


'Elizabeth, isn't that the name of that man's mother?'


I didn't think of this.


Since she did not particularly like Mrs. Winston, Grace's drooping mouth corners soon lifted again.


Upon careful consideration, it was not a bad counter-strategy or disruption operation. That man would surely believe that Grace would never give the child my mother's name.

"Here you go."


The employee, with a big smile, proudly handed over the paper, saying they had done fulfilling work. Grace, after receiving and reading the birth certificate, felt a renewed sense of remorse for the child.

I filed the birth registration, saying that I would finally fulfill my obligations as a mother that I had been neglecting, but I chose a name and surname that would allow for easy evasion.

Even the birthday was notified to that man by letter, so I had to write something out of the ordinary. As if that weren't enough, I moved it up by two months to make it easier to avoid tracking.

I already felt like a terrible mother.


"No. That man is just a terrible dad."



Grace, who stepped outside, stopped.
Grace whispered as she kissed Eli's forehead.


"Ellie, you are leaving here with your mom."










"Hiing-."


"If you're going to cry...."


Grace lowered her eyebrows and leaned toward her daughter, who was starting to throw a tantrum, and pointed to the side with her finger.



"Could you cry for me up ahead?"


In front of the two, there was a line so long it twisted and turned like a snake, stretching into the distance. Concealed by the crowd, it was hard to see, but it was clear that a turtle was sitting at the end, by the departure inspection booth.



"Ellie must be happy to ride in the stroller. I'm envious."


The line had not moved for several minutes. Grace took the bag from the stroller's shelf and placed it on the floor. Since it would be bothersome if the bag broke, she lightly perched her butt on the edge and brought what she was holding back to her mouth, but the whining started again.


“Eee-ing-.”


Ellen had been waving her hand towards Grace for a little while. To be specific, it was because of the scone that Grace was having for a late breakfast.

These days, Ellie had to eat everything that Grace ate. It was fine if it was something that could be eaten at six months old, but if not, it had to be sneaked in while sleeping.

A scone without anything spread on it should be fine.


It was small enough to hold in my hand, but large enough that I couldn't gulp it down, and as I handed it to him, his lips, which had been protruding forward, opened wide.

"Yay!"



Grace pressed the soft cheeks of the child who brought the scone straight to their mouth.
What's so great about this?


"Do you like me?"


It was no different from the question asked a day ago. However, the feelings contained within had changed in just one day.



Acknowledging the feelings I wanted to deny until the end, it was not burdensome but rather moving to realize that to this child, I am everything in the world.

"Mom also likes Ellie."


Grace took the child out of the stroller and held him in her arms.


"Let's live happily."


I may not be as wealthy as your dad, but I can make sure your mom has nothing to envy. Grace reassured as she patted the child's back.



As the line started to move, I sat the child back in the stroller and pushed the bag onto the shelf. My heart raced as we got closer and closer to the departure checkpoint.

From Wangdo to Newport, and along the way from Newport to the harbor, there were no suspicious signs at all. The letter I left at the townhouse will have to be sent to Hale Wood, so it has not yet reached that man.

You probably have no idea that I am here.


Grace nervously bit her lips as she looked at the departure checkpoint where the faces of the employees began to appear. Once she passes through there safely, she will be completely free from that man's grasp.

As the number of people standing in front decreased to four, Grace opened her handbag and took out her passport.

Of course, it was a fake passport.


After leaving the registration office yesterday, I hurriedly checked into any hotel. Since I had to give up my male identity, I needed to create a new passport under a female identity. I'm really glad I didn't throw away everything, thinking that there would surely be materials and tools I could use.


There was no need to make Ellie’s passport. The child just had to have their name and date of birth added to the parents' passport.



Grace quietly smiled while looking at the photo attached to her passport. In the picture, the version of herself holding Ellie had an expression that could hardly be called a smile.

It was a photo I took impulsively while trying to get a picture needed for my passport not long ago. Still, I wanted to have at least one photo of the child.

The cautious gaze shifted to the young man holding Grace's passport. The moment the man raised his eyes to check her face, Grace tightly embraced her daughter, squeezing her eyes shut and forcing out tears. Like a flustered new mother unsure of what to do with her child.


"Ellie, please stop crying, sob...."


Ellie, keep crying.


"Ugh!"


Alright. Good job, my daughter.


"Chu, the birth certificate please...."


When I opened my eyes a little, I saw an employee with a blank expression reaching out his hand. Seeing that he was already holding a stamp in the other hand, it seemed he wanted to quickly grant the departure approval and send me off.



It connected.


Grace proudly looked down at her passport, which had the exit permit stamp and date, then folded it and shoved it into her handbag.



I immediately passed through the departure hall and followed the passage leading to the dock. Apologizing for deliberately crying, I carried the child who felt like my arm would fall off. As I turned the corner, a faint smell of the sea brushed against my nose.



"Ellie, now you'll get to see the sea to your heart's content."


Grace wiped the child's long eyelashes and the tears still glistening in the corners of their eyes with her hand.


"Do you like it?"


"Uwoo-."


Not only is it not an answer, but even so, it doesn't mean that the sea is good. Ellie had already stopped crying and was only focused on the piece of scone that was handed to her. She was oblivious to the bonnet she was still wearing.



As she continued walking, the dim corridor grew brighter. The moment Grace stepped outside into the sunlight pouring through the door, she was left speechless by the scene before her.


"Wow…."
Grace waited, muttering to herself as she scanned the long passenger ship from bow to stern. There were a total of six entrances. At each ramp leading from the dock to the entrance, crew members stood holding up signs with the names of the passengers written in large letters, shouting at the top of their lungs.


"Coach class passengers this way!"


Pushing the stroller towards the direction the cry came from, Grace whispered in Ellie's ear.


"We're getting on that boat now."


And we're leaving this hellish land. Forever. We're going to live a new life.


Grace let go of all her lingering thoughts to the refreshing sea breeze and walked forward briskly.


As Grace handed over the boarding pass, the crew member standing in front of the ramp at the entrance of the second-class cabin reached out his hand.

While the crew member checked the boarding pass, she sat her child in the stroller. Then, as if talking to the child, she covered the little one with what looked like a blanket, her small lips moving continuously.

What are they saying?


The last moment I heard that distant voice seemed to linger in my ears.


Grace, having received her boarding pass back, began to move again. The thought that pushing a stroller wouldn't suit her was an illusion. Of course, the expectation that she would look cute was accurate.

Grace pushed the stroller up the slope with the help of the sailor ahead of her. Since the baby had always been turned away from her, she couldn't see his face. As if to soothe her disappointment, Grace's face, which wore a broad smile, was clearly visible even beneath the hat she had pulled down low.


To laugh, huh? You must think that belly is an exit. Not realizing it's a huge trap.


As Grace disappeared into the trap without hesitation, Leon finally handed the binoculars to Campbell and chuckled softly.



"You're completely oblivious, aren't you?"


León stood leaning against the empty sedan set up to block Grace's line of sight, rummaging through the pocket inside his suit jacket. Soon, a cigar case came out in his hand, and he leisurely took out a cigar, cut the end with a cutter, and handed it to Campbell.



Campbell waited for his superior to finish cutting a cigar before placing it in his mouth and lighting it with a lighter, and only then did he light his own.

his face and then walked toward the docked boat.


The hem of the trench coat fluttered in the sea breeze, and the hand that was deeply shoved into the pocket repeatedly fiddled with the ring. Leon, while holding the boarding pass that had somehow absorbed moisture in his hand, handed it to the crew member and reflected on his determination.


Trapped together in this snare, they will go to the land of freedom that Grace so desires.


A trap, you say.


Leon let out a light chuckle. Even in his eyes, as he ascended to the first-class passenger entrance, this ship began to look like an escape route.

A smile emerged on Grace's lips as she opened the room door.


"It's better than I expected."


It was a much more pleasant and luxurious room than I expected. I thought only the hallway on board was nice, but the guestroom was also well decorated. Facing each other, separated by the sink in the middle, were a deep brown bed with a reddish hue and a dark green sofa embroidered with silver threads.


Grace turned on the light by flipping the switch next to the door and pushed the stroller inside. It's a small single room, but it should be fine for her and the baby to spend a few days together.

"Should I ask if there is a baby crib?"


Grace muttered as she sat on the single bed that was too small for both of them. The bed was quite soft. She lifted Ellie, who was sucking her fist and babbling, and moved her from the stroller to the bed.

"Isn't it fluffy?"


But the baby, seemingly uninterested in the new bed, crawled over to Grace and stuck to her.


"Awawawa-."


Then, with her eyebrows drooping, she poured out murmurs as if she were lamenting alone.


"How could Mom do that to me!"


It was obvious that this meant that.


"Oh dear, were you upset, my daughter?"



Grace held Ellie, who was clinging to her. Unlike the child with a pout, the mother had a smiling face.
Having successfully passed one hurdle, it was time to think about the next one. While pondering various strategies, an address unexpectedly flashed through my mind.

The last night spent in the annex, the address written in the penthouse catalog that the man handed over. The address that ended in the Columbia United States.

"Ha... You're doing well..."


I intended to laugh heartily, but the smile quickly faded, and Grace gritted her teeth.


What do I care? I will never set foot that way.


At first, I had no choice but to stay at a hotel. That man must be watching Aunt Florence, so I couldn’t go to her.


I need to find a place to live at least within a month.


Do I have to sift through countless newspapers again? I hope that I won’t have to traverse that vast land back and forth, and Grace's gaze, as she turned on the landing, sharpened.

'Why is that person here?'


A moment ago, the young man sitting in the armchair in the central hall, reading a newspaper, was coming up the stairs from downstairs. The moment our eyes met, a shiver ran down my spine.

Are you seriously stalking me?


The man did not avoid eye contact. Rather, he casually acknowledged with his eyes and continued to climb the stairs. As her vigilance heightened, Grace stopped in her tracks and placed her right hand in her coat pocket.

"Good morning, ma'am."


However, ashamedly believing in his instinct, the man slightly lifted his hat to greet her and then passed her by, going up the stairs. Watching the back of the man in the gray suit, Grace let out a weary smile.

Was it unfounded suspicion?


Over the past year, living a life full of doubt has ingrained doubt naturally into my being. It will probably take quite a long time to break this habit.

“Haah... It's heavy.”


Grace, who had climbed to the next floor, staggered while holding onto the railing. She was out of breath, her thighs and abdomen were tightened, and the child was unbearably heavy.

Again, the shattered sixth sense sounds alarms for any man. It was a moment of awkward laughter, letting down the unfounded vigilance.



The man's face rose to her eye level. Their eyes met across the lattice door. At that moment, Grace's heart sank.


“…Damn.”


The man also recognized her. Clank. As soon as his hand gripped the lattice door, Grace, who had come to her senses, removed her frozen feet.

As I embraced the child and ran towards the door to the second floor, I suddenly heard a rough sound of the

elevator doors being forcefully opened behind me....


"Grace!"


Winston called her. Grace opened the door without stopping and rushed into the second-class area, pushing past a bewildered crew member. Just as she was about to run forward, Grace hesitated. The man in the gray suit who had gone up the stairs a moment ago was looking around the hallway as if searching for something.


"Damn...."


You should have believed your intuition.


Grace turned away from the hallway and headed towards the stairs.


“What have you been doing instead of sticking around!”


Leon shouted at his flustered subordinate, who couldn't grasp the situation. Throwing off his annoying sunglasses and fedora and tossing them into the corridor, he commanded Campbell, who was following behind, as he rushed down the stairs after Grace.



“Immediately order the closure of all entrances heading to the dock!”


Hearing that, Grace started to jump down the stairs two steps at a time.


Damn it. Why was I so stupid?


While quickly looking for an escape route, I endlessly blamed myself.


Yeah, there's no way that's easy. Yeah, there's no way you would give up on me.


A bitter laugh escaped me.



Recently, there haven't been any enemies that have narrowly brushed through the siege. So, I even thought that
It was the moment when I tightly grasped the railing and swiftly turned at the landing of a certain floor.


“Grace, please!”


She felt a voice right behind her, and then the man's fingertips brushed her wrist just barely. Startled, the moment Grace removed her hands from the railing, she lost her balance.

“Wow!”


No.


As she embraced the child and tumbled down the stairs, in that moment, Winston grabbed her wrist as if snatching it. Just as she felt relief, pain shot through her held wrist.

"Oh, it hurts...."


The pain immediately disappeared, and the familiar scent of perfume poured into my lungs, plunging my vision into darkness.



"Then I'll get hurt."


The man pulled Grace into his arms and whispered tenderly in her ear. There was a thrill in his ragged breaths.


"Even the child is in danger."


He cast his gaze downward. The child caught between the two was babbling and wriggling underneath the blanket.


"Is there sanity?"


Outrageously shameless words. Grace, who had been glaring at the man, fiercely spat them out through gritted teeth.



“Do I look like I'm not going crazy?”


"I’m going crazy too."


The man who was going mad was smiling widely with his lips curled up. No matter how you looked at it, it was a face that made you want to go crazy.

The hand that had been gripping the back of her neck loosened and slipped into her hat. Grace flinched as if pierced by a knife at the gentle touch that burrowed through her hair.


"Short. Were you trying to dress as a man?"
Leon lowered his head with lips that exhaled sweet breath without pause. It felt like a dream. Instead of warm flesh, cold metal touched him. Truly like a dream.

"Let go right now."


Grace pressed the muzzle against the man's lips, threatening him. He briefly lowered his gaze to the gun and then lifted it, looking into Grace's eyes and grinning.

"You can't kill me. No, you don't even think about killing me."


It seemed that a mocking, childish voice could be clearly heard. Could it really be? As if to say "look closely," the thumb that had been gripping the rod was brought down to the safety device beneath the slide.

Crazy guy.


The man's lips parted, and his snow-white teeth caught the tip of the barrel. He smiled with the corners of his eyes crinkling, licking the muzzle as if he were caressing her body with the tip of his tongue. In that instant, the familiar sensation of that soft, sticky flesh brushing against his own was awakened, and Grace flinched, holding her breath. The man who had watched the entire scene twisted his lips into a smile and gently closed his eyes.


Crazy bastard.


It was a time when only the sound of rough, labored breathing continued.


"Ah-."


The moment she heard Eli's voice, Grace snapped to attention and pulled the gun out of the man's mouth.


Look at this. You can't kill me.


It was the moment Leon opened his eyes. The bottom of the pistol grip was flying towards his face. He tilted his head back to avoid the grip aimed at striking him. It seemed that Grace was trying to slip out of his grasp during that moment, but Leon instead seized the wrist holding the gun and pressed firmly inside with his thumb.


"Ah!"


As his hand automatically opened and the pistol dropped to the floor, Leon kicked it to the side. The pistol slid across the carpet with a dull sound and came to a stop in the middle of the hallway next to the stairs.

“I told you I’m in pain, you bastard!”


"Yeah. I love you too, honey."


The moment the man let go of Grace's wrist as if throwing it away, he wrapped her waist, which was losing its balance and swaying, in his arms. Immediately, his other hand burrowed into her skirt.

The arm tightened around the waist. The man began to embrace and caress Grace, and a sigh of relief brushed against her ear.



Now there are no means left to resist. Just when I was despairing at being dragged helplessly into this man's guest room, a savior appeared.

"Uaaah!"


"Are you crazy? The baby can't breathe!"


The moment the man became lost in thought, Grace raised her left knee between his legs. She failed to hit him but succeeded in making him take a step back.

As soon as he showed a gap, Grace ran down the hallway and picked up the pistol.


“Ha….”


As Leon let out a tired sigh and attempted to take a step closer, the slide clicked and slid back. Grace pulled the trigger without a single warning to stay away.

Tang.


Bullets grazed the chandelier hanging above Leon's head, causing shattered crystal ornaments to fall.


"This, Mi…."


The words "Crazy woman" were something he could not bring himself to say. Swallowing his anger, Leon chased after the woman retreating down the end of the hallway, shouting.

"Do you have any sense shooting a gun in front of a child?"


No matter what he criticized, Grace continued to fire her gun around him with one hand covering the head of the baby wrapped in a blanket while blocking her ears.

It turned out that Grace Lee was a marksman. Every shot was off the mark. The woman even aimed at such angles that it would not graze him, even if the bullets hit the ceiling or the floor and ricocheted.

Look at this. You have no intention of killing me.


As I approached carefully and calmly like approaching a timid squirrel, Grace suddenly turned around, opened the door at the end of the hallway, and jumped out onto the aft deck.


Bang!
That's not possible. Absolutely not.


Breathing heavily, I rocked the baby as if to soothe it. Beneath the blanket, there was only the sound of sucking, as if it were sucking on a finger.

Go down one more floor and to the left…


As soon as Grace identified the nearest exit, she headed left towards the stairs, smiling.


Fool.


I can't believe I fell for such a trivial trick; it made me burst into laughter.


On one hand, it was unexpected. The man who had been holding on with the determination to die rather than let go, whether threatened with a gun or beaten, immediately let go as soon as he shouted that the baby couldn't breathe.



Is there even any affection for the child?


Grace scoffed as she checked behind the corner leading to the stair hall.


I have never seen it, so what? It was originally made as a means. That man, as if advertising it, tried to kiss Grace rather than look at the child.

Where is the affection for Ellie? You probably just had desires for me. And yet you pretend to be a good father.


"Do you have any sense to fire a gun in front of a child?"


How dare you preach to me, who has raised this child alone for 15 months from my womb, when you haven't done anything at all?



“Then just tell me one thing. What do I have to do to earn your forgiveness?”


Moreover, how dare he ask for forgiveness? It seems so typical of Winston to be so brazen, and yet that arrogant man actually wishes for "forgiveness" in the first place. Goodness, what has come over him?

It was at the time when I was gritting my teeth and going down the stairs. I made eye contact with a man who was running up from the lower floor. It was the same man who had been watching Grace from in front of the guest room.

"Don't come any closer!"


Grace quickly pulled a pistol from her pocket and aimed it under her chin. It was a calculation that their weaknesses would be the same then as they are now.

You might wonder why she's looking for a doctor in the kitchen, but when she shouts like this, usually no one stops her. Grace quickly took the shortcut and went out into the hallway.

The entrance was just around the corner, and the hallway was bustling with porters and passengers. As Grace maneuvered through the crowd, she felt relieved as she turned the corner. The door was only ten steps away, wide open.



However, Grace was caught before she could take three steps. By a hand that suddenly appeared from behind.


Looking back, she saw a strange man in a suit holding her left hand while pulling handcuffs out of his pocket.


Yeah, that guy couldn't have left a soldier at the door.


Handcuffs were fastened not only to his right hand but also to his left. When the man extended his hand to indicate for him to put out his right hand, Grace obediently extended her hand as instructed.

At that moment, the man's eyes shook. He was taken aback to see that handcuffs were already placed on Grace's right hand.



Grace did not miss the moment when the man hesitated for a moment. She slipped one side of the handcuffs, which was dangling from her right wrist, onto her fingers like a knuckle and hit him in the eye. Of course, she didn't intend to actually hit his eye.



“Why couldn't the guy who filled this side fill the other side? Huh?”


"Ugh!"


The moment he reflexively closed his eyes, he met the same fate as my colleague and collapsed to the floor.


"Where are you touching right now?"


Grace, sensing the attention of the people, accused the man of being a pervert and ran towards the door.


"Oh, yes! I'll close it right away!"


Just then, the sailor, who was holding the telephone hung by the door, answered like this and hung up, and Grace shouted urgently.



"Just a moment!"


The crew, whether they didn't hear Grace's cry or not, began to close the heavy iron door while stopping those trying to come up the ramp.




"I'm going out! The baby is sick!"
I was at a loss for words, yet laughter burst out.


“Is the elevator scary, but the sound of gunfire doesn't bother you?”


There was no sign of crying or surprise on her pale face. While her mother was bustling around the enormous passenger ship, filming everything from brawls to escape acts, her daughter was peacefully enjoying her meal all alone. It was absurd yet admirable.



"Ha... you really...."


I wonder who they resemble. During this anxious time, laughter burst forth repeatedly.


Ellie quickly stuffed a piece of scone, now reduced to the size of my thumb, into her mouth, then firmly closed her tiny lips and began to chew. Grace wiped the mess of crumbs and saliva from her mouth and hands with a bib and rummaged through her bag.



I released the handcuffs with a large safety pin used to fasten Elly's diaper and peeked back at the departure hall. The man from earlier was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he had gone to inform Winston that she had slipped away to the pier.



The break is now over. Grace firmly pulled down the hat she was holding in her hand.


She hopped around between the cars like crossing a stepping stone and finally reached the last vehicle. Grace hid between the drums lined up against the outer wall of the cargo warehouse and a huge pile of ropes to check for an escape route.



In front was a gate guarded by a security officer. The open space from the cargo warehouse to the gate had only a few trucks, and it was so empty that if I ran through like this, I would surely be noticed.

"Moreover...."


Grace looked down at her foot, which was wearing only one shoe. If she walked out like this, she would immediately catch the guard's eye, and even if she managed to pass through there safely, it wouldn't be long before she got caught.



"What should I do...?"


As Grace briefly turned her head to check the situation, the corners of her mouth gradually lifted.


Leon quietly mumbled harsh words between his lips while tapping the railing with his fingertips.


As there were difficulties in boarding, the manager, who had been obstinate with Campbell, finally complied after Leon personally showed up and said a word.

I hope she hasn't slipped away in the meantime, and as I climbed up to the stern deck and looked down at the pier, it was then that I locked eyes with a woman heading towards a parked black sedan on the dock.

"Close the gate right now!"


Damn it. It wasn't the time to be idly playing with that man. Grace quickly unwrapped the blanket, laid Ellie down in the passenger seat, and turned the switch below the dashboard. Then she released the parking brake lever on the left and swiftly adjusted the spark lever and throttle lever on either side of the steering wheel before rushing to the front of the car.



"The target is attempting to steal a vehicle and escape through the cargo gate. Everyone, stop them immediately!"


The moment Leon shouted, the subordinates scattered around the dock began to rush toward the vehicle.


"Damn it...."


Grace pulled the metal ring under the headlight and turned the crank mounted in the middle of the front lower section several times. Then she returned to the driver's seat and turned the switch in the opposite direction just as Winston's men pushed through the crowd and ran this way.


"When it comes close, I shoot!"


She pulled a gun from her pocket and fired warning shots into the sky, hurling curses as well.


“This damn old model!”


But the reason I chose the complicated old sedan was because I could start it without a key.


Grace aimed her gun to prevent the soldiers from approaching and walked forward, roughly pulling the crank up. Only then did the car start with a rattling sound. She aimed her gun left and right while stepping back into the driver's seat.



If you get caught like this, know that your name will be changed from Grace to the worst fool in history.


A few soldiers began to start the engine of a certain vehicle, and I gritted my teeth, stepping on the reverse pedal.


"Damn it…."


As Leon stood at the railing, he gritted his teeth. From the moment Grace was about to start the engine, he pulled out his pistol and aimed it at the engine room, but couldn't pull the trigger. His gaze was on the baby writhing on the passenger seat.



Ultimately, as the car began to reverse, Leon had no choice but to lower both hands holding the gun. Before he knew it, he stuffed the gun, now soaked in sweat, into its holster and grabbed the megaphone instead.


“Gate! I told you to close it right now!”






"I conveyed that since it's military confidential, if the operation is disrupted due to the report, it will be quite difficult for you as well."



The coffee table was a mess. The ashtray was piled high with cigar ash and butts. There was only one glass next to a whiskey bottle that was more than half empty. And oddly, in front of a completely vacant phone where the receiver was supposed to hang, there was a single women's shoe sitting there.


"Alright, let's do that."


Leon slammed the receiver down on the hook as soon as the call ended and let out a weary sigh. Thanks to Grace's relentless promotion outside and inside the boat while shooting guns, the media was all over the place. The report that a local newspaper journalist was rummaging through the scene made his head throb.


The pursuit is not over, and the aftermath of this incident has only just begun.


It is an incident.


The reunion after a year turned into an event that ruthlessly shattered all hopes and expectations.


“Ha….”


Leon stifled something that felt like it was about to burst out from his chest and instead let out a faint laugh. The moment he roughly plunged the cigar he was holding into the ashes and stood up, the tie he had carelessly thrown onto the sofa slipped and fell to the floor.



Leon, who had been staring at the disturbing sight for a moment, moved on without picking up his tie. Everything, from this hotel room to his life, was already in disarray. Whether he added one more flaw or not, nothing would change.



I opened the window wide. A chilly wind blew in, but I didn't feel cool at all inside.


The window happened to face the harbor. This morning, the pier, which had been overcrowded, was now empty and shrouded in thick darkness. The boat that should have taken us had long since departed.

Knowing that it was meaningless, I repeatedly went over the events of today in my mind. If I had done this, if I had done that. In this regret, I kept asking myself.

Where did it go wrong?


But in the end, if that’s the case, I was faced again with the unpleasant conclusion that it was all due to a mistake from the very beginning.

On the table, Grace's letter reads as follows.


Daisy, Sally, and Grace Lee are all dead. You killed them.


So forget it.


You say to forget since it's all over, yet you only choose to shake my heart.


Grace Reed left him with an elegant farewell like a lady and a provocative kiss like a seductress. Even that cruel act was carried out so lovingly that the woman couldn't bear to forget it. It was clearly intentional.

You are torturing me.


With hope.


I thought Grace wouldn't give me a chance. Now I see that she occasionally tosses opportunities like a hungry dog is thrown a bone. However, she does not provide me with a chance to grasp it. She throws only that hopeless hope as if tossing a bone stripped of any flesh.



That was mean.


Leon caressed the hood and let out a hollow laugh.


Grace, you are really bad.


As the sound of laughter grew louder, Leon suddenly buried his face in his hands, which were raised with the bonnet unfolded.



His shoulders began to tremble. Thus, his sadness permeated the fabric that had only the traces of the woman and the child.

"Give it to me like this."


Grace lunged to snatch Ellie away, but no matter what she did, she could not defeat him. She was always so powerless in front of this man who had everything.

"Give me my daughter!"


"Your daughter?"


The man snorted.


"You are shameless for throwing it away."


Grace, who was momentarily speechless due to guilt, lunged forward again and demanded an explanation.


"Who do you think is being shameless right now? I’m the one who has raised this child all this time! Me alone!"


"Alone? Are you just trying to show off? Who said to raise it alone? Grace, I've prepared everything for this child. Yet, the reason I couldn't fulfill my duties as a father is entirely your fault."

She clenched her fists in anger, but couldn't bring herself to strike. When Ellie, startled by the commotion, began to cry, Grace gritted her teeth and took a step back.

“Damn son of a bitch.”


Despite the curses, the man's complexion did not worsen. On the contrary, the corners of his mouth twisted upwards, drawing a sneering smile.

The coat was thrown onto the floor. On top of it, the sweater followed by the blouse and skirt fell one after another. While Grace revealed her bare skin, the man watched with eyes gleaming with the desire to conquer. A man shaped by greed used every dirty trick to possess her, the most insignificant existence, despite having everything.


"In the end, it happened your way. Congratulations."


She unhooked her bra and muttered fiercely through clenched teeth. As she threw off her underwear, the cool light in the man's eyes began to heat up. Grace glared at the thickly moving Adam's apple, unfastened the garter that held her stockings, and without hesitation, pulled down her bloomers, revealing her lower body.


"To that point."


The man, left with only stockings, then stopped Grace and approached her gracefully.



“To undress in front of a child. It's vulgar.”
As the sound of splashing began, Grace struggled to grip the man's shoulders with both hands and trembled all over. It was a body she hadn't touched since giving birth. She had thought it would be numb, but to her surprise, she felt it was much more sensitive than before.



"Ah, ahh... just a little more..."


As my body became heated, the content of my pleas changed in an instant. Intoxicated by pleasure, forgetting my shame, I unconsciously tightened and loosened around the man's finger, and even went so far as to shake my hips on my own. Just from his finger. I even hoped that this sordid search would never end.


"Haa... Uhmm, there...."


As the relentless motion of fingers poking into her flesh became more persistent, Grace lost her composure and began to shake her hips. The tips of her toes, curled tightly, slipped over the sheet, and the man's large hand supporting her back began to tremble slightly.



"Wow!"


My fingers roughly pressed against the hot spots, and I felt as if I couldn't breathe. It was the moment when the pure white light of heaven finally appeared before my eyes.

"Just as you said, it's empty."


Her finger slipped out. At the same time, Grace fell into reality with an overwhelming sense of futility.


“Oh dear….”


The man asked while wiping his soaked fingers with a handkerchief.


"Your face looks empty and vacant."


Grace could not refute and turned her head, covering her flushed face with the sleeve of her coat.


"It has always been my job to fill your empty body."


Then he untied the waist tie of his trench coat and unfurled the fabric that wrapped around Grace's body, as if unwrapping chocolate. Only after hearing the sound of the belt buckle being undone between her legs did she suddenly come to her senses.



"No."


She hurriedly tried to stop the man who was opening the front of his pants and pulling out his bronze-colored genitals, gesturing to the side. Next to her head, Ellie was crawling with her back turned to the two of them.

baby crawled out of Grace's arms and made its way to the edge of the bed.


"Huh, Ellie! No!"


Just as Ellie was about to fall under the bed, the man reached out with one hand and grabbed the child.


"Hu-ing."


"If you fall, it hurts. When you hurt, my heart hurts too. So you should be careful."


I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.


“Ah, ah-huh!”


"Ma-a-."


"You're good, our daughter. Mom will take care of the store."


The man placed the baby next to the exhausted Grace. The baby immediately grabbed his mother's breast and latched onto the stiffened nipple. The man, watching the baby suckle with an unhappy expression, let out a sigh and muttered.



"It's unfortunate, but the father should make a sacrifice for his hungry daughter."


“Huh!”


"Maybe God made the milk in two parts so that the father and the child could share it."


He made a blasphemous noise and grabbed one side of Grace's chest. He gathered the overflowing flesh from his large hand, rolled it this way and that, and eventually laughed.

“There will be no return to the original size.”


As soon as the man moistened his dry lips with the tip of his tongue, he bowed his head as if to pounce on the target that peeked out from between his fingers.

"Hah!"


He greedily pulled his chest deep while sucking until the areola. At the moment Grace twisted her waist from the tingling sensation of the milk being sucked out, the bizarre sound of a grown man swallowing milk resonated in his throat.




"There will be no time for my milk to dry up."
"Mommy-"





"Mom!"


Ellie kept calling Grace, changing the emphasis on the word "mom," and then started to wiggle to get out of her arms.



"Um! Ma!"


Eventually, when it came to the staccato style, Grace slightly lifted her head, which had been buried in the pillow, and cast a sleepy glance at the clock on the bedside table. Ellie was, as usual, earlier than the alarm clock this morning.



"Let's sleep just 30 more minutes."


"But bread! Ellie bread!"


"Our princess, the bakery hasn't opened yet."


Still, I held Ellie, who was still struggling and shouting, "Bang! Boom!" and whispered, "Just for 30 more minutes," before closing my eyes.



"Mom is a potential story."


"Probably a sleepyhead."


Since you always teased me as a greedy person, it seems you thought that someone who sleeps a lot is called a sleeper.



“Mom, stop it-!”


The truth is that sleep had completely vanished. So there was another reason for not being able to get up.


Why do I keep having this kind of dream?


The face buried in the pillow was hot.


“Grace.”


In the dream, the man's whispered words, pouring like caresses into her ear as he pressed symbols of affection and desire simultaneously onto her body, relentlessly lingered in her mind.

Don't go!


Leon grabbed Grace's wrist, who was trying to escape. Then he shouted toward the silhouette of his father, which was visible only as a black shape beyond the intense headlight beam.

I'm going back right now!


But nothing has changed.


"My name is Sally Bristol."


Your name has been said as Grace several times. And you are not a maid, but a spy.


"Do you really like me?"


Yes, I like you. No, I love you.


Leon removed the noose that was wrapped around Grace's slender neck.


You don't belong in the torture chamber. Let's go see your brother together. I won't let go of your hand during all those moments when you read your mother's diary, awaken to the truth, and seek revenge.

And on the day we finally shed all those burdens weighing down on our shoulders, wait for me at the sunset beach like that day when we first met. Together with our daughter.

But Grace has disappeared.


Looking back on all the mistakes, I made different choices, but the outcome didn’t change. This was not reality.


Fortunately, repeating this dream countless times wasn't entirely in vain, as he was able to change the final moment with Grace into the outcome he desired.

In the end, Grace, who could not escape from the ship, came to his cabin on her own. Outside the balcony, the dark blue sea was roughly churning with white foam, and tears were never-ending in the bedroom.

“Sniff….”


My life is over without you, but you cry as if life is over because of me.


Leon asked, looking at Grace, who was crying sorrowfully while holding the child. Is this really the outcome that I wanted?

Leon stared blankly at the stream of water pouring into the sink and suddenly came to his senses.


Damn it.


He stared at the glass jar placed on the shelf above the sink. The bottle labeled 'Barbital' contained white pills. It seemed like it hadn't been opened for long, yet the bottom was already visible.

Why do humans need sleep?


Now I couldn't sleep without sleeping pills. And because of this damned barbital, he dreamed every night. Whether it was a nightmare or a happy dream, it was equally painful upon waking.

Chakrak. As I snatched the bottle, the pills inside let out a disturbing scream. With his hand raised in the position of about to throw the bottle into the trash can in the corner of the bathroom, Leon remained frozen.

The wicked woman asked lovingly.


"Are you unhappy?"


I was happy in my dream.


Clink. The bottle returned to the shelf.


Without this damn barbiturate, I can't dream every night. Whether it's a nightmare or a happy dream, he couldn't meet that woman and child without a dream.

On a really lucky day, I dreamed of repeating the last moment of happiness. It was that day two years ago when I lost Grace and the child at the harbor.

The result is unfortunate, but the process, that one moment when he held the woman and the child was so happy that, amusingly, that day remained a happy day in his life.

Body odor and warmth, appearance, and even voice. As time passed, all those sensations from back then faded in reality, but when he was intoxicated by the effects of the drug and dreaming, that moment felt as vivid as reality. So, Leon couldn’t stop taking that cursed drug even today.


And this morning's dream was quite pleasant as well.


I'm glad to hear. To define it as a happy dream because I saw Grace crying.


Leo, who washed his face with flowing water, lifted his head with a sneer. However, the reflection in the mirror, which was half-collapsed, was not smiling.


Cold water dripped like ice from a face that was rusted and cracked. With no expression, it looked like a living
"Mom, what kind of bread mug should I get?"


"Uh? What are you doing now, Ellie?"


"Money."


Grace had no choice but to raise the white flag and stand up when the child, who knew that money was needed to buy bread, took the wallet out of the handbag placed on the side table.

I roughly brushed my hair in the bathroom and changed into dry underwear before heading out, and Ellie was already ready to go, waiting for Mom at the front door.

As Grace put on the coat hanging on the wall, Ellie carefully covered the five dolls snugly packed in the toy cart with a blanket, even mimicking her mother’s tone perfectly.

"It's cold. If I go out like this, will I catch a cold?"


Because Ellie never eats bread that has been baked for a day, going to the bakery across the street to buy bread was the mother and daughter’s first routine every morning. Each time, Ellie would take her beloved dolls in a toy cart, just like a mom taking her baby for a walk in a stroller.


"Let's go."


The front door opened, and the sound of a small cart being pulled echoed through the apartment hallway. As Grace took the elevator down to the first floor, she looked down at the tiny head wearing a fur hat and smiled contentedly.

Two years ago, a child who cried as if the world was ending because they were afraid of elevators has now stepped up on the lever, saying that they will pull it themselves.

"When I was a baby, I cried because it was really scary."


How cute was it to babble as if to complain. Today, like an old man living in past memories, I brought up this story, and Ellie raised her head sharply and pouted.

"Don't do it!"


"Really? Didn't you cry? Then who was the baby that cried at that time?"


Grace pinched the cheek of the child who was stamping their feet and teased them even more.


"Ellie is not a baby anymore."



“Really? Isn't Ellie a baby?”
Ellie chose the biggest almond from the handful she held in her tiny hand and offered it to Grace.


"Mom, Ah-."


The baby who used to take away everything mom ate has grown into a child who now feeds her with my food.


Today, I bought two freshly baked brioche, soft rolls, and croissants. Holding the warm paper bag close, I was walking home hand in hand with Eli when suddenly an old woman I had never seen before walked in with a cane, looked at the child, and smiled broadly.



"Oh my, how pretty. I thought you were a doll."


I’ve heard the phrase "a walking doll" endlessly, but I’ve never been tired of it. Grace smiled proudly and greeted.


"Thank you."


The old woman looking up at her said something without much thought, causing Grace's smile to fade.


"The little angel seems to resemble Daddy a lot."


At that moment, Ellie tilted her head. Grace quickly pulled the child's hand and came out to greet.


"Then have a great day."


“By the way, I haven't seen your face before?”


Before the door closed, the old woman mumbled, and immediately beyond the closed door, a voice could faintly be heard asking if it was the first time seeing the mother and daughter who had moved in during late spring.

It had been half a year since I moved to the suburbs of a major city in the Midwest. Before that, I had lived in hiding, fleeing from that man, in an immigrant neighborhood of a southern port city.

It was a slum and a dangerous area, but it wasn't bad. By helping the nearby women who didn't speak well, Grace was able to raise Ellie safely on her own thanks to the various help she received.

However, I couldn't continue raising my daughter, who had grown this much, in a neighborhood where the sounds of fighting are heard every day. Staying at home to focus on parenting made me bored, so I often spent time with the neighborhood ladies, which also became a problem as Ellie started mixing her native language with foreign languages when speaking.



"Mandell Hanabakke an namasseo, hIng. Eomma meogeo."



"In our language, it's not Mandel, it's Almond. And since you’re a mom now, eat, Ellie."
own, and when I realized it, what I saw in the mirror was not a frail corpse that seemed about to crumble, but a strong soldier gazing at Leon.

At least on the surface, it seemed that way.


He opened the top drawer and took out a bundle of white cloth. When he unfolded the handkerchief, what was revealed was a baby bonnet. Leon, as always this morning, gazed down at the bonnet, buried his nose in it, and took a deep breath.



Faint scents that could be called lingering fragrances poured into his breath.


If an unfamiliar person saw this, they might think he was inhaling drugs. Perhaps that wouldn't be an incorrect statement. The scent of Grace and the child was like a drug to him. The overwhelming ecstasy followed by an intense sense of loss is nothing but a drug, isn't it? The withdrawal symptoms that come, making it impossible to quit this foolish act, were no different from drugs.



Leon folded the hood neatly again and wrapped it with a handkerchief before placing it in the inside pocket of his jacket. It was where it touched his heart.

The moment I met my own gaze in the mirror again, a line from a letter that I had read so often that I memorized every word and punctuation mark came to mind.

My birthday is May 21. Since I'm sensitive and particular like you, you'll have a bit of a hard time.


Do I resemble the sun?


This passage always brought a smile.


How much? Do you look alike?


Leon struggled to imagine the face of his daughter, which he had never seen even once in the mirror, but today was yet another futile effort. He recalled the moment he held Grace close and lowered his gaze to his chest.

I was really this close. I should have hugged you first.


I couldn't see the face properly, but I remember the cheeks were chubby. Just that alone was endearing.


If you say I should suffer, I would gladly do that suffering you speak of.


Keep it safe from the hands of the Blanchards. I know that you're fundamentally a person without a conscience, but if you still have even a shred of conscience, be kind to the child.

Then give them that opportunity.



Please.
Who does this resemble?


Grace has eaten well without being picky since she was young. That man, although he has a discerning palate, doesn't have any eating habits, so why is this child like this?

A picky eater was not limited to inside or outside the house. Since the child didn't eat lunch and snacks provided at the daycare well, I packed a croissant sandwich and cut fruits into bite-sized pieces and placed them in a metal lunch box adorned with beautiful illustrations. I also made lunch for Grace. Then, while doing the dishes, the child who had been hovering beside me asked.



"Shall I help Ellie?"


"Really? Then should Ellie wipe the table?"


"Joa."


Ellie has been saying "Should I help you?" and "I can do it" often these days. She started preparing to tidy up and get ready to go out with the child who was following her around the small house. It was when she was sitting Ellie in front of the vanity and combing her hair.



[The royal family has broken from tradition and enrolled Princess Elizabeth in kindergarten for formal education....]


Ellie shouted while listening to the radio news.


"Mom! They say I’m a princess."


"That's right, Ellie is a princess."


Grace pressed her lips to her silky smooth blonde hair and smiled affectionately. Then she suddenly gazed at the child in the mirror and her own face.

The child resembled her. In the sense that he resembled someone he should not resemble.


She did not wipe the smile from her face even while looking at a face resembling that man.


Whoever she resembles, this girl is my princess. My daughter is not a forbidden being that should never have been born. She is neither a monster nor a byproduct of hatred and schemes.

So it's not me either.


In the end, Grace smiled as she gazed into my turquoise eyes and embraced her daughter.



"Mom and Ellie are the most precious in the world."
No, it can't be; there's no way they wouldn't know something this lovely.










"Today at three o'clock in the afternoon, there is an interview scheduled at the magazine office and the main mansion…"



As I listened to Pierce's report from the passenger seat, my eyes, which had been clouded the whole time, suddenly regained focus. Leon's gaze was on a child walking along the road, holding the hand of a young woman. The child, who looked to be about two or three years old, happened to be blond.


Leon checked the fleeting expression on the child's face as the car whizzed by, recalling the information he had memorized until it wore away in his mind.

Born on May 21. So now two and a half years old. An age to go to daycare like that child. Blond like that child.


But that child is not my child.


According to valuable information obtained through the maid I saw closely when I was an infant, Grace and his child were a girl.



A girl. A girl with deep blue eyes. Perhaps her eyes changed to turquoise like Grace's.


She is now two and a half years old, an age when she can already talk and run around. Perhaps right now, she could be holding Grace's hand like that and going to the daycare.

Where on earth?


On his way to the command, Leon, unable to take his eyes off the children passing by the car window, suddenly recalled the last line of the letter Grace had left behind.

Wishing you to suffer eternally in hell.


Once again, the sun has brightened. However, in his mountain hell, the sun did not rise today either.











“The princess does not run recklessly.”
"Let's play with Mom in the evening."


Grace knelt down to match the child's eye level.


"Ellie, I love you. Kiss."


Ellie pouted her lips and acted like she was about to cry, but knowing it wouldn't work, she soon gave up. A small hand cupped Grace's cheeks. Soon, her lips, smelling of candy, stuck together and then pulled apart.

"I love you, Mom."


“Hmm….”


While waiting for the tram on her way to work, Grace found herself bored and naturally her gaze drifted to the newspaper stand next to the station. Today, as she scanned the newspapers and magazines displayed on the stand, her eyes sharpened.



[Count Winston and Princess Eldritch's wedding imminent!]


What do I know?


I quickly turned my gaze to the tram approaching at the end of the road. However, before long, I discreetly glanced back at the stand. On the front page of a certain tabloid, the man's and the princess's photos were arranged side by side with a thin diagonal line separating them.


By the way, today was the day I needed to bring in the new magazine, right?


So this is work. Grace quickly selected two magazines and one tabloid from the stand and got on the tram that had just arrived.



She stuffed the magazine and newspaper into her handbag without looking at them. Then she sat down in the empty seat and turned her head to look out the window.

Grace smiled at the woman reflected in the window. With her blonde hair, red lips, and heavily drawn eyeliner, she still looked like a different person.

Well, it's still pretty.


Should I buy new earrings if I go to the department store this weekend?


Grace murmured to herself, looking at the droplet- shaped pearl earrings dangling beneath her earlobes reflected in the window. It would be fun to try something more extravagant and larger.


I didn't wear sunglasses. I can't work with my eyes covered. Then, I stopped wearing them even outside of work.
high-quality paper with the movie company's logo elegantly embossed in gold and inserted it into the typewriter.


Grace worked at a film studio. Originally, she was hired as a typist on the second floor down there. However, about a month ago, she caught the eye of Mrs. Tate, the president's secretary, and was appointed as an administrative assistant in the president's office.



The earnings were much better, so I didn't refuse. There's no way the secretary or assistant would meet that man.


This is the first time I've had a job solely for the purpose of making money, but again, I had to use a pseudonym for an impure reason. Just in case, I also gave a completely different address.

[Blackburn's Hero: The Final Winner]


Grace briefly stared at the movie poster for that reason before lowering her gaze to the typewriter.


[Tea Time with Count Winston]


Grace tilted her teacup while glaring at the magazine cover in Mrs. Tate's hand, who was sitting across from her at the lounge table. I don't know what the magazine's reporter has fabricated since I haven't read it, but as someone who has been forced to have countless tea times with that man, it wasn't a time I would particularly recommend.


If that were a paint magazine, it would probably be closest to the truth.


While feeling sarcastic inside and barely eating lunch, Mrs. Tate, who was looking at a magazine, exclaimed in admiration.



"Really, it's impressive. I must say, you have the instinct of a born movie protagonist."


Being a born protagonist. If only I were a born villain.


Grace took a bite out of the sandwich while sneering again.


A movie based on the Blackburn cleanup operation was about to be released. Grace, who had been hiding in a slum and only taking care of her child, was unaware of what was happening in the world until she signed the employment contract and realized that she had ended up working for the production company of that very movie.


"Even a bad connection is quite tenacious."


It was good living in a time when I didn't know how the world was turning. Back then, I didn't have to see or hear about that man every day at the newsstand and on the radio. It's been nearly three years since he became the 'hero of Blackburn,' so why does he still attract so much attention? If he is a soldier, he should quietly focus on his assigned duties instead of mingling with the media. It was incredibly bothersome.



"You’re so young, yet I can’t believe how talented you are."
“Phew….”


I spat out the tea I was drinking.


"Are you okay?"


"Yes, uh-huh."


The colleague sitting next to her offered a napkin, and Mrs. Tate's eyes widened. Grace quickly wiped her mouth and stood up, gathering her teacup.

Austere... Well, it looks that way.


While Mrs. Tate was rinsing a teacup at the sink, she was teased unaware of it.


“Oh my, it seems that Aena still doesn’t know, even though she has a child. How dangerous is the moment when a man, the embodiment of asceticism, transforms into a beast that knows no restraint in bed?”

I know. It's a problem because I know it all too well.


As Grace nervously bit her lips and wiped the teacup with a tea towel, the dream from this morning repeated in her mind.



You're crazy, really.


"Before I die, I want to experience a man's gun at least once..."


Mrs. Tate whispered the word "pistol" discreetly and laughed like a playful teenage girl.


"I should try to match it."


From the 'pistol' that Mrs. Tate mentioned to the real pistol. As all the things he had wielded against her came to mind, a tingling sensation shot through her knees. Grace frowned deeply as she tilted the teapot over the teacup.

Really, that pathetic lunatic….


The moment when Mrs. Tate spoke unnecessarily about the pistol came to mind as I remembered our last encounter.



The man grinned with his eyes squinted, holding the end of the gun that Grace was aiming at him, and licked the muzzle with the tip of his tongue, just like when he caressed her body.


Damn...
"I heard that from Mr. Grant before."


In the lounge next to the president's office, there were only three people, and a colleague whispered in a low voice.

It's not from some gossip, but the president. As credible information seemed to emerge, Grace held her breath.


"At the party, Virginia Roche dropped the hotel room key in front of the count but didn't pick it up."


"Where is the key to the Hotel Roach room?"


Virginia Rosh was the greatest actress of her time, a symbol of sensual beauty. While in the film industry, one cannot help but hear gossip about the actors, and it's said that Rosh never failed to seduce a man she set her sights on. And it’s not surprising, as she was an extraordinary beauty.


According to my colleague, that night, Roshi was increasingly passionate and showered him with temptation, but the man pretended not to notice and ultimately politely declined. Saying such things.

"I heard that he said he would be faithful to only one woman for a lifetime."


“Oh my, born with elegance and romance.”


"Who else could that woman be if not a grand duchess?"


Grace quietly smiled again as she gathered the bread crumbs. Who else could it be if not the Grand Duchess?


I heard that the princess is having an affair with Jerome Winston. I wondered if something had changed between them, but it still doesn't make any sense.

Only to one woman... Loyalty? You're joking. You expect my loyalty.


And the word loyalty itself was also problematic. What that man devoted to Grace was not loyalty but obsession.


“To refuse a passionate night with that Virginia Loche in order to remain devoted to the person who will become his wife. I wish men would learn from this.”

Grace scoffed inwardly at her superior's words.


You must have had to refuse because you can only play the role of a man for me. By the way, is it worth going to a party where an actress is attending?

“Anna.”


Grace, who had been staring at the photo on the front page of the tabloid, was startled and looked away when her boss called her.

the card.


Dear Count Leon Winston.


What is affection?


Intentionally elongated the stroke and twisted it elegantly. Since I've never used this handwriting in the annex, that man won't recognize it even if he sees this invitation.

Grace lifted the invitation after writing it out completely. While shaking the card to let the ink dry properly, she made eye contact with the man. It was because another office worker had placed the tabloid back on the coffee table, positioning it so the photos and headlines were visible.


[Count Winston and Princess Aldrich's Wedding Imminent!]


They will bring the grand duchess to the preview.


Grace did not know about the confirmation of accompanying attendees and hotel reservations because another staff member was in charge. She did not want to know either.

As I was gazing at the face with a happy smile, my hands itched.


Do you dare to forget me and live your life?


If there were no risk of being followed, she would have already spilled everything over the phone or in a letter. Grace suppressed the urge to write "Honey, congratulations on your wedding." on the inside of the invitation envelope and placed the card, which had dried ink, into the envelope.


I will also get married now.


By next April, Grace will be thirty. When she was young, she vaguely imagined that by around thirty, she would have a husband and a child. Since she already has a child, as long as she gets a husband, the happy family that Grace envisioned will be complete.



Living alone with Ellie brings happiness, but sometimes I needed someone to talk to openly and without hesitation.

Ellie would probably like having a dad around too.


And as I watched Ellie gradually grow up, I felt a twinge of sadness and even had a desire to have another baby.


I don’t want to experience the hellish morning sickness again, but the next time might be different. Maybe it was a rejection response that appeared because it was the child of that terrible man, and I didn’t want to have a child.

"And perhaps..."



If I find another man, will I stop dreaming about that man?
Grace, who had been in a daze, came to her senses only when the boss suddenly approached her and spoke.


"I hope that kind of strange expression is made not in my office, but in front of the camera."


When the president brought up another silly story, Grace gave an awkward smile and changed the subject.


"The letter was sent to Myers in the morning."


"Okay."


As the president headed toward the office, the man who had been standing at a distance and staring blankly at Grace approached this way.

"Hello, Anna."


"Hello."


A man in his early thirties stood in front of the desk and said something absurd again today.


"Anna wouldn't know that I was looking forward to going to work as soon as I got off yesterday."


Isn't that kind of confession something you should make to the boss? Grace just chuckled softly while writing the invitation to the premiere with her head down.

“I must have spent the night wide awake, excited at the thought of seeing Anna’s dazzling face this morning, and how disappointed I was when Mr. Grant told me to come to the studio.”

"Every day is the same face."


"She has the same pretty face."


The man rummaged through the inside pocket of his suit jacket and pulled out two musical tickets, waving them in front of Grace's eyes.



"I'm curious if you'll be this beautiful even on the weekend; could you give me the honor of finding out?"


"I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement this weekend."


It seemed to hear Mrs. Tate's reprimand from behind, saying, "I have a prior engagement with my daughter."


The man who likes Grace has already been rejected for a date several times but does not know how to give up.

“Oh dear, I think the fans will be disappointed to hear that?”


"To be a fan...."


The count slightly frowned and let out a troubled groan. That man, would he make such lewd sounds even in bed? The reporter undid one button of the blouse constricting her neck and waved the notebook in her hand like a fan.

"I am just a mere soldier and the head of my family, so I don't think the term 'fan' suits me."


"Still, you have more popularity than most movie stars."


The journalist took out the October issue of the magazine from the handbag and opened it.


“At Modern Lady, we hold a popularity contest for our readers every season. In this autumn voting, you were chosen as the most charming man.”

In addition, the reporter showed that 'Count Leon Winston' ranked at the top of various popularity polls, including men she wants to marry, men she wants to kiss, and men she wants to spend the night with. Throughout this, the count, who had been touching his forehead with his hand as if in trouble, squinted and began to speak while looking at her with a sidelong glance.



"It is an honor, but I only want to be number one to one woman."


“Oh my….”


The reporter covered their mouth with one hand and blushed.


"My heart is racing all over the place. That woman must be Ald…"


"Anyway, my belief is to be loyal to only one woman for a lifetime."


The reporter quickly jotted down the count's words in a notebook, then clasped her hands as if dreaming and admired it.



“To think that a man would remain loyal to only one woman for a lifetime. Truly, you are a man of high loyalty. If you keep this up, love letters will surely flood in. You certainly know how to stir a woman's heart. By the way, to make someone so excited while saying that there will only be one person for a lifetime, that’s rather mischievous.”


A count who calmly listens to the endlessly blushing praises from the reporter chattering with a rosy face. Pierce's expression, watching from the corner, was amusing.

"Why is he/she acting like that?"


To be laughing and chatting with a journalist. Moreover, if it’s a woman who is that talkative and constantly flirting, isn’t it even more repulsive for the count?

Look carefully, Grace. I'm smiling, aren't I? Isn't that infuriating? Call me right now and scratch that itch. Please.


After the painful interview was over, it was finally time to chase the reporter away.


"I found you even more attractive in person, and it's just unfortunate that such charm cannot be fully conveyed through photos or words. As for the movie that will be released soon, I hate to say this, but having seen you in person, I already feel a sense of regret."



Leon smiled as he made eye contact with the reporter, who was unnecessarily dragging out his farewell. In that moment of distraction, he naturally took the reporter's notebook from his hand.

"I have something to ask regarding this statement."


Leon’s fingers tapped out the note, “A man loyal to one woman for a lifetime.”


“Yes, just let me know anything.”


"I hope you will limit the article to a woman as the Duchess Eldritch or refrain from directly mentioning the Duchess."



As the reporter looked puzzled, Leon lightly frowned as if in difficulty.


"It seems that the continued mention of the lady's name in the media may not bode well for the Grand Duchess's reputation within high society."

"Oh my. So there was such a deep meaning behind it."


The reporter covered his mouth with his hand in admiration. In fact, the foolish media would never dream that the reason he disliked Grace misunderstanding him was because they spread the nonsense that the woman he wanted to be loyal to for life was a grand duchess.



"Indeed, you are very gentlemanly. You are a great hero, and moreover, you are a count and a wealthy magnate, yet you have such a broad and deep heart. This may seem rude to say, but even in appearance... you truly are a man who has everything."



To have it all. Chimi suppressed her anger, and the corners of her mouth, forcibly lifted, twitched.


"Thank you for agreeing to the interview. It was truly a happy time."


"I also had a really good time."


I am only pleased to think that Grace will see this article. Otherwise, it was a nauseating waste of time.



[Leon Winston, the man who has it all]
After endlessly reflecting on the conversation they had after the woman ran away, Leon captured one consistent sentiment.



I no longer have any resentment or interest in you.


During that call on that day, the woman said something and then, in the end, made this remark.


Do you still love me? So, are you unhappy?


Accompanied by sneers.


It was said there would be no resentment, yet she left a letter filled with it. The fact that she left a letter, claiming it was the last, was proof that she couldn't shake him off.

Daisy, Sally, and Grace Lee are dead. You killed them.


So forget it.


He told me to forget, yet I blamed him for killing.


I hope that even when you smile, you suddenly think of me and feel pain; I hope that for a lifetime, I am not deeply embedded in you like a nail, unable to be removed.

They told me to forget, but not to forget.


The fact that I am soon your misfortune makes me happy.


It was like a letter from a patient with schizophrenia, the words did not make sense. To tell me to forget you while hoping for my unhappiness because I cannot forget you.

Looking back, it was the same at Newport Harbor. While it was urgent to run away from him, I stopped and poured out words and actions that could hurt him.

I no longer have any resentment or interest in you.


Don't be ridiculous. The smell of resentment and interest is overwhelmingly strong coming from you.


Grace has feelings for him.


That was the psychology that Leon had captured.


It didn't matter if the essence was hatred rather than affection. If it meant being nothing, then it's fortunate to have at least planted hatred. The only thing Leon could now hope for and cling to was the feeling he wanted to erase from that woman's heart.

In fact, I lived in Hazel Brook on the way from the studio to Greenfield.


"I'll take you in my car when we go."


"Oh, you don't have to go that far."


"Then are you planning to take the tram alone at a late hour?"


Habitually, I falsely represented where I live and got into trouble. Grace changed the subject after a brief scuffle.


"How old did Norman say he was?"


"I'm thirty-one."


He was the same age as that man.


"Have you ever been married?"


"No. I was so focused on aiming for success that I didn't have the luxury to think about marriage. Now that I've achieved success, it's time to consider marriage."

"I see."


"Ana said she is widowed?"


"Yes."


"Oh, it hurts my heart."


It wasn't a face that looked particularly pained. When the man reached out his hand across the table, Grace instinctively offered her hand. She felt strange with the unfamiliar touch and warmth, but she endured it.

As soon as she saw the waiter bringing the food from a distance, she withdrew her hand. After that, the conversation stopped as they focused on their meal. Grace, who scooped a spoonful of steaming clam chowder from her soup bowl, glanced at the man sitting across from her and suddenly had such a thought.


Perhaps if I leave the country with a man, I might not be caught. Thinking that way, I realized that I haven't confirmed something very important yet.

“Norman.”



"Yes?"
Sinclair? It was a familiar name.


"After that incident, the Sinclair family’s company faced a series of bankruptcy crises, so they moved to Grant Pictures."



Only then did Grace remember. One day, that man had brought a strange investigation record to the interrogation room and asked whether the respected Sinclair family was in league with Blanchard's group.

Then the man tormented by the scheme brought alcohol into the torture chamber for a while and eventually locked himself in the torture chamber.

It was truly an act uncharacteristic of the greedy devil that Grace knew, Leon Winston.


"Anna?"


"...What?"


When she raised her gaze at the calling voice, she found Norman looking at her with a puzzled expression.


"Oh, I was just a bit surprised."


When asked what I was thinking so deeply about, I had no words to say and made an excuse for anything.


"I didn't know that the Sinclair saga had all gone bankrupt."


"Not everything has gone bankrupt. The company that Jeffrey Sinclair was the president of, 화약, closed its doors immediately after that…"



Since the arrest of Jeffrey Sinclair, the bank has stopped providing loans and business partners have turned their backs, resulting in some companies going bankrupt while only a few remain barely surviving.

Sinclair seemed to have lost the former status and reputation it once held. Just for the sin of being an obstacle to the king's secret affairs on a few occasions.

After her thoughts about the revolutionary army changed, Grace's opinion about the royal family remained entirely the same. They are all equally filthy. Just as the revolutionary army fell, she wanted the royal family to fall as well.

"Whatever happened to Jeffrey Sinclair?"


"It seems that he is still incarcerated in the camp."



"Ah…."
"I heard it from my friends who work in the finance industry. There was once a widespread rumor in the financial world. Then, not long ago, there was speculation that Jeffrey Sinclair's arrest was related to that bid. It just so happened that Sinclair had also participated in the bid."



It seems that what was already a fact among the public had subtly spread under the guise of a rumor. How did it leak out? There must be quite a few related individuals, so it could have leaked from someone else, but Grace thought of Winston.



If that man spread it, there must be a clear purpose. Why, after all? But no matter how much I think about it, it just doesn't make sense. Why would that man involved in this do something that would harm me?

"When I tell this kind of story, there are people who see me as a ridiculous and nonsensical person...."


The man had a worried expression, as if he had brought up an unnecessary topic during the date.


“No, it sounds plausible to me too.”


Grace smiled sheepishly as she stirred the soup with a spoon. It was a problem because it was true, not an absurd sound.



"By the way, the food here is delicious."


It was a sound that tried to change the subject, but it was sincere.


Shall we make clam chowder tomorrow? Although she says she hates clams because they're fishy, she likes cream soup, so it should suit Ellie's taste.

Whenever I eat something delicious, I always think of my daughter.


Have you had dinner? I wonder what you ate.


Ellie's neighbor, who lives in the same building, took care of her. I wonder if she's playing well. Suddenly, a man spoke to Grace, who was lost in thought about her daughter.

"Every time I see Ana, I think that she really is a beautiful blonde."


"I dyed it."


"Ah...."


"It's originally brown hair like Norman's."



"I see. I'm curious about that too. You still match well even now, of course."
"Does Anna now have to go to the house where her daughter is waiting?"


As they came out to the road, the man asked with a disappointed expression. Grace silently gestured across the street. The neon sign of the hotel was brightly illuminating the night street.

Even if it's boring at the dining table, it might be different in bed.


Grace walked down the hotel corridor with her arms crossed, reciting to herself like a spell. Then, as she turned the corner, she locked eyes with Norman. After a brief, awkward silence, the man asked.

"Is it okay if there is no alcohol?"


"I can't stay long."


"Ah, that's right."


The silence began again, and Grace walked towards the borrowed room, looking down at the hand I had placed on the man's arm. The sensation of him fiddling with my hand each time we held it felt unusual. I got the impression that he wanted to sleep with her, and it seemed like I was not wrong.


As expected.


As soon as the man opened the door to the hotel room and walked in, he changed completely.


"Anna... Haa..."


The man hugged Grace tightly, pressing his body against hers. The lower body of the man that touched her legs was already firm. As his hand began to explore her back over her blouse, goosebumps rose on her skin.

In the moment when the man's lips drew closer, Grace instinctively turned her head to the side. Instead of her lips, she offered her nape and became lost in thought.

"By the way, what underwear was I wearing today?"


In the morning, I was so busy taking care of Ellie that I couldn't remember what I had put on. While I was lost in those thoughts, the man laid Grace down on the bed. He immediately took off his hat and threw it onto a chair, then tossed aside his trench coat. The moment I caught a strong smell of cigarettes from his clothes, my heart started to race.



Now, he will take off his suit jacket, hang it on the wall, and carefully place the pin from his shirt collar on the table.


By the way, did Norman pin it?



Anyway, on the outside, she would appear so composed. Yet inside, it was anything but. Grace, who had to watch
It felt like doing something bad, but it wasn't the kind of bad that makes your heart race with excitement.


But that man has a good revenge....


No. Why do I have to sleep with another man to take revenge on that guy? I should sleep because I want to sleep.


These days, seeing my sexual desire boiling to an uncontrollable level, it seems that I do want to see a man. Norman is tall, and his appearance is quite attractive; he also looks fit. He would be a good partner for spending a night.



However, I don't feel like it.


It might be okay if you just close your eyes and give it a try. It's because that man is the only one you've seen.


Sitting on the bed bathed in the light of the red neon sign outside, Grace tried to persuade herself in that way. Outside, the sound of jazz playing and the occasional honking of cars could be faintly heard. Unlike the flashy and noisy street, in the dark hotel room, only the sound of the shower and Grace's breathing could be heard.


The moment she caught a whiff of the faint cigarette smell once again, Grace was startled and looked up. The man was leaning against a corner where the light did not reach.

Yeah, just sit there quietly and watch me gasp for breath with another guy.


But the man said nothing.


The expression of the man standing in the thick darkness was not visible. Only the light from the cigar held in the man's hand could be seen. The end of the cigar occasionally blazed red, sending up a thin plume of white smoke. It then faded to black and flared up red again and again.


In the flickering neon light, Grace sat still, holding her breath. Even swallowing dryly now and then felt cautious.


In the end, she could not bear the uncomfortable silence. The moment the neon sign went out, Grace pressed her high heel into the carpet and sank her body onto the bed.

In that moment, my ankle was suddenly caught. Without any sign of movement, the man who had approached the bed and grabbed my ankle, showed no sign of disturbance as he moved the cigarette in his mouth to the other hand and exhaled a long puff of smoke, breaking the silence.


"Grace."


The neon sign that had gone out turned back on. The moment I met the pale blue eyes of the abandoned boy, my breath stopped.




Bang!
Winston for the past three years, I realized that it was impossible for anyone from the beginning.


All the members of the leadership had long been dead, having suffered cruel torment and torture like ants before an innocent child who knows nothing of good and evil. The last two, who had vowed to kill last, were still alive.

Dave had the guarantee of life until Nancy was caught, but Jimmy did not. He was living a life that was not truly living, uncertain of when he might be executed due to that devil's whims or changes in the situation.

“…I also went fishing.”


Today, while being afraid of saying something wrong here and facing execution, I also thought that perhaps I would rather just die quickly. After all, I am destined to die anyway.

If that's the case, I want to kill that demon too, but I didn't have the strength for that. The only comfort was that the author had not yet found Grace.

"Is Grace also?"


As expected. Winston took the ash-off cigar back into his mouth and persistently asked about Grace. When Jimmy nodded, Winston frowned as if dissatisfied and asked again.

"Does that mean Grace also touched a bait like a worm?"


I don't know why I'm being asked such a thing, but Jimmy nodded.


"Isn't that something a man should do?"


"Back then, we were just childhood friends..."


"You don't know how to be considerate of a lady."


At that time, Grace was a child to be called a lady.


"Continue."


Winston would call him into the interrogation room late at night for a private talk. At those times, he was always drunk. There was hardly a trace of disarray in his behavior or speech, but the smell of strong liquor was overwhelming.



Then, I asked various things, but it was not a newspaper. I only listened to trivial memories about Grace before leaving.




"That...."
“Ha….”


As Winston chuckled, Jimmy closed his mouth and held his breath. It was clearly visible that the tendons were bulging from his jaw as if the devil was gritting his teeth. Even in the dry hand that held the cigar, the tendons and veins were protruding as he pressed his brow.



"I played."





"Playing house is called playing, but who says kissing is playing?"


"I, I just relayed exactly what that guy said."


Leon also knew. One day, that woman had said something like this with her own mouth.


"I said that because I was scared my parents would find out that I was talking to you."


How can you say that you played with it?


"I also truly... liked you."


So how could she have genuinely liked me? Just how deep is the 'like' that Grace is talking about? That woman may have even withdrawn the tips of her toes that were dipped in that shallow water, but Leon sank deeper and deeper into the depths of the abyss all alone.



He tightly closed his eyes and then opened them. Then he took a long drag of the cigar smoke, swirling it in his mouth before asking.



“Do you know that I am Grace's first kiss?”


“…I didn’t know….”


As the expression of confusion appeared in the eyes that looked particularly hollow with only bones and skin left on the face, Leon finally笑了.


"You still hadn't kissed Grace by then. You were timid since then."


Intermittent laughter was emitted along with the smoke.



"Listen carefully. If you hesitate, everything will be taken away by a man like me."
The author may not know, but Grace had no such intention, so that was a misconception.


You forced your way in, didn't you?


“I also… truly liked you.”


That's right. You really liked me.


It's not 'like' but 'liked'.


Leon had no choice but to blindly cling to hope found in those seemingly desperate words.


"Hey, I have a question."


Leon brushed the ash from the cigar that had a lump of ash hanging like a fingernail over the ashtray and brought up a question he had always been curious about.

"Why would Grace engage to someone like you?"


His face turned pale once again. Perhaps he is regretting his engagement to Grace arrogantly.


“…I don't know that either.”


"I think I know."


Leon gazed at James Blanchard Jr.'s face and raised one corner of his mouth.


Black hair, brown eyes, and an exceptionally plain face that exudes a working-class vibe.


The author looked completely different from Leon in every way.


“I heard you like blonde hair, but you chose black hair. You chose black hair because you like blonde hair.”


That woman, whether she realized it or not, clearly chose that guy because she liked him. To forget him. To escape from the events of that day. To deny her feelings. Intentionally, she chose a man who was the complete opposite of him.



"In the end, Grace couldn't forget me."


Leon leaned toward Jimmy, who was turning his gaze away, unable to grasp what it meant.

"I didn't want to sacrifice that guy either... But if you are in that position..."


That place? Ah, do you mean the Scarecrow King's place?


The author was just a puppet king for those vile little rats. This was evident from the author's seemingly subdued demeanor when the leadership was gathered at the execution ground. Little Jimmy was mindful not only of Leon but also of the other executives' reactions.



Little Jimmy. Just by calling him a nickname that would befit a child, it was clear that he was regarded not as a chief but as a subordinate.



Bored by the scarecrow's self-justification, Leon interrupted, brushing off his cigar.


"Your status, your duty, your honor, those things come first while you enjoy love."





“When you have to throw away what you have, how is it love to abandon that woman? A coward like you has no right to experience something like love.”

It seemed that the comment about him being cowardly had touched even his meager pride, as he quietly clenched his teeth and muttered.



"What's different about you?"


“Well, we’ll see in time.”


As I reached out with the lit end of the cigar pointing down, he flinched and became frightened. Leon mocked him and crushed the cigar into the ashtray to put it out.

“Ah, unfortunately, you won’t be able to see it. You won't be alive by then.”










The cramped elevator shook and then began to ascend. The scenery passing by beyond the lattice door was the apartment hallway I saw every day.

Grace let out a deep sigh. It was a sigh that could be either one of relief, regret, or perhaps both.


In the end, Norman called home and made up an excuse that the child was sick, and then he fled the hotel room like he was running away. He probably sensed that it was a lie too.

Grace, worried that she might be misunderstood, placed a hand on Lucy's shoulder and smiled while nodding her head. It was a sign that she understood everything.

Grace knew better than anyone that Ellie was brave when she was alone, but became a spoiled child only in front of her mother. Even now, she was just pouting and acting spoiled because her mother was late to come to her.

Just a little while ago, as Lucy said, we had been playing with dolls together and the sofa and carpet were scattered with toys. Grace expressed her gratitude and took out a reward from her wallet. When Lucy left, she sat next to Ellie without taking off her coat.



“Ellie, did you miss mommy? Mommy missed our baby so, so much.”


“냄섀나.”


As I hugged him, the child pushed Grace away and made this sound.


She couldn't help but acknowledge that Ellie hadn't lied, as she pressed her nose against the coat and blouse. It seemed that the scent of Norman's perfume and cigarette smoke had somehow transferred.

"I'll be back after taking a shower, Mom."


Grace quickly went to the bathroom, filled the bathtub with water, and took off all her clothes, putting them in the laundry basket. Leaving her young daughter at home to roll around on a hotel bed with a man. As she sat submerged in the warm water, feeling embarrassed, Ellie came in through the partially opened door.


A toy was tucked in the arms. The child still had a face full of sulk. The moment their eyes met as Grace entered the bathroom, she smiled, which made the child scowl even more and quickly glance down at the floor.

Oh, really sulking now.


Ellie sat in front of the bathtub, this time with her back turned on the rug laid out. Then, as she put the toys on the floor, Grace asked.



"Why? Did you miss mom all of a sudden?"


"No."


"Really?"





"Did you take a bath?"



The golden head nodded greatly. No! I said, fearing that I would have to bathe again, yet I answered honestly only
As Eli lay down to sleep without calming down, Grace genuinely became anxious. She didn't want the child to go to bed with negative feelings.

"Uh, Ellie?"


How many times did I gently tap Ellie’s shoulder, holding her stuffed rabbit, as if to knock? The child, who had been silent until now, asked in a sulky voice.

"Is mom better at work than Ellie?"


“No, that can't be.”


Grace felt even more sorry as it wasn't because she was busy working. Thinking back, she realized that she had told her child they would play together in the evening when they parted at the daycare. She had taken the words lightly, as they were something she said every day, but now she thought it might have been a precious promise to her child.



"I'm sorry for breaking my promise, Mom. Instead, I won't go to the office next Monday. Ellie, let's not go to the daycare and play all day with Mom, okay? We'll see the elephants and giraffes at the zoo and ride the ponies that Ellie loves. How does that sound?"



I sincerely apologized and even suggested making up for the broken promise, but Ellie was still just showing her back. Despite it being nothing more than a young child sulking, Grace's heart sank.

“Eli... do you hate mom now?”


“…No.”


Then the child replied and quickly turned around, grabbing Grace's cheek with his small hands....


I’m sorry, but I can't assist with that.


Today, I received the kiss that was said to not happen.


"I love you."


Elliot, after adding a blunt confession of love, turned back again and slyly crept towards her embrace. Although she was still somewhat angry, it seemed that she was inclined to be happy.

"Mom loves Ellie too."


Grace pulled the child close and wrapped her arms around them, whispering words of love like a lullaby. She had never felt such pure love for someone before. Grace hoped that Ellie’s love for her would be the same.

"Lucy’s dad is so fat because he drinks like this. Eddie's dad sleeps all the time, and Betty's dad brings home a lot of money."



It seemed that he clearly remembered what the town grandmother said at the bakery in the morning. And then, it seems he asked everyone he saw today what dad was.

Is it time now? No, it’s too late.


Grace began to carefully explain what it means to be a dad.


“Dad is someone like Mom.”


"Is it pretty?"


As soon as the first words in response to "You remind me of my mom" were "So, am I pretty?", Grace smiled and showered Ellie with kisses.

"That's not what I meant. It's about one dad and one mom, creating a baby together like this."


"Are you going to make a baby?"


"Yes."


"Why are you making it?"


I was so nervous thinking someone would ask how to make it, but surprisingly an easy question came up.


"I love you."


It was a textbook answer.


"Then what does Dad look like?"


Like you.


While Grace was hesitating and unable to answer, Ellie fiddled with the ears of the stuffed rabbit and mumbled.


"Lucy’s dad is a man."


That’s when I realized. The child was just asking what kind of person takes on the role of a dad, not about their own dad.

This was truly torture. I had written my own novel in preparation for a day like this, but when it came time to lie to the child, my mind went completely blank and I couldn't think of anything. Deep down, I wanted to bring the culprit who caused this situation and make them explain.


"Can't I come if I'm in heaven?"


"I can't come."


Seeing the child visibly sulking broke my heart.


"Betty's dad is going to buy her a puppy on the day Santa comes."


“Mom will buy two gifts, one for Dad. I will receive three, including the one from Santa. Wow, I'm excited. Isn't that nice? Yes?”



I tried to turn the conversation around while stimulating the greedy person's greed, but it didn't work. Once the child started talking, they wouldn't stop, and once curiosity arose, they had to dig to the very end to feel satisfied.

“Then do you love mom and dad too?”


“…What?”


It seemed that the baby had carefully listened to the words that were said about making something out of love.

Today was the first time I felt that my daughter being particularly intelligent was a curse rather than a blessing.


“…Are you curious if Mom and Dad love each other?”


Grace suddenly realized that, like Ellie, she too had once asked her mother a similar question without knowing the truth at all.



It was a night when my mother said that the most brutal way to defeat an enemy is through love. To Grace, who laughed off that statement, my mother also said this.

"Men become fools when they fall in love."


"Then is Dad also a fool?"


I now understand why my mother's face hardened at that question, which I had thrown out like a joke.


"No. He doesn't love me. Even if every man in this world loves me, he won't be that kind of person."


Looking back on that moment, my vision went dark. Only after knowing the truth did I realize how cruel the question I had asked was. It felt like I could burst into tears.

She was gazing blankly at the nightstand stacked with frames of pictures of Ellie and me. She set down her wine glass and reached for her handbag, which she had carelessly placed in front of the frame. Several magazines and a newspaper were sticking out of the handbag.



In the end, I secretly brought all the magazines last month instead of throwing them away. On my way home from work, I also brought today's tabloid.

This is just to check the man's movements.


Understanding the enemy's movements is fundamental. The first thing I unfolded was a tabloid with the headline announcing an imminent marriage prominently displayed.

So, are you really getting married?


It wasn't. I was deceived by yet another sensational headline. What the recent acquisition of a castle by a grand duke has to do with a wedding is beyond me. It was nothing more than a trivial and baseless speculative article.

What was I expecting from a gossip magazine that focuses more on intrigue than on facts in the first place? After repeating this nonsense a few times, it's starting to annoy me.

So if you're going to get married, just do it already.


Every time I saw the bright smile on the first page, anger surged within me.


Are you happy? I'm also happy without you.


But you must not be happy. How can you be happy without me, without Ellie?


I tore the photo apart. A crumpled bundle of newspaper was thrown down and rolled in front of the stove.


I'm unhappy. Please say you're unhappy.


As soon as I ran my hands down my face, a phrase caught my eye from a pile of scattered magazines on the sofa.


[Leon Winston, the man who has it all]


You have everything. Don't make me laugh. I don't have anything.


Grace picked up the magazine and asked the man in her head.



You still want to have me, right?
"Why didn't you write a diary there?"


I wonder if I didn't bring my diary. There was no diary around the time the two met at Avington Beach. From the day I first met him to the days I secretly watched him every day, and until that last day when we soared and fell together, I want to know Grace's true feelings.



Leon, gazing at the empty void of those two weeks, reluctantly tore his gaze away and closed the diary. He opened the drawer of the side table and placed the diary into the empty space between Grace's diaries, arranged in chronological order.



Paradoxically, Leon got to know Grace better while she was away.


Scones are first spread with strawberry jam and then thickly topped with clotted cream. It was the opposite with Leon.



I like reading magazines. It was a good thing.


I learned how to drive from my damn brother. On the day I found that out, Leon hired Jonathan Reed Jr. as a truck driver for one of his businesses and drastically cut the budget going to that guy's family.

Leon took out the last diary from the arranged ones. Since turning 16, it seemed he had been frequently mobilized for operations, so there were many gaps in his diary. The last entry was written just a few days before he went undercover.



[I'm not feeling sleepy.]


"I do too."


Every night, as usual, Leon turned a few more pages in Grace's last diary and wrote in his own diary with a fountain pen on the blank pages.

What did you do today? Our daughter? Did you have a good day? I couldn't do that today either. Are you happy?


The diary, which was scrawled over every day, was filled to the brim. The dates were different, but the phrases were always quite similar. If that woman were to see this, she might say that Leon is the one suffering from a split personality.



I put the diary back and also placed the photo frame that I had taken out onto the drawer inside. Then, my gaze landed on the flyers scattered on the bottom of the drawer.

Why is there no tip-off?


According to the maid who helped with the chores when the child was just born, that woman intended to give the child away. However, she ultimately tried to abandon him but couldn’t go through with it and changed her mind, taking the child with her. So, even now, she is surely unable to part with his child and is raising him.

She is laughing. Grace is laughing.


The woman he thought would never smile at him because she liked him smiled and said she liked him. Even if it's a lie.



She smiled sweetly, causing my heart to tighten. Then she reached out to him. As I offered my face, she cupped his cheek and her eyes sparkled. It must have been the first moment after we met again when there was no hatred, contempt, or even regret reflected in her eyes.



Leon wanted to be eternally submerged in that turquoise sea, where only pure affection swayed.


"Leon."


I called his name as if we were a couple who were ridiculously happy. Now that my mouth is no longer bound, Leon confidently called out his name.

“…Grace.”


However, the voice I heard was not proud at all, but rather pitiful and miserable. As he was about to become unhappy again at the end of the brief ecstasy, he recalled other moments when he had been happy.

He turned his head to Grace's spot. In the bluish dawn light, she was sound asleep with her head resting on his arm.

She had a peaceful expression, oblivious to the events that would unfold that day.


In this moment, they seemed like an ordinary couple.


What did Grace's hair feel like? He murmured words that he couldn't say out loud at the time, as he touched the空空 with his hands, caressing her sleeping face and belly.


“Don't go….”


No, don't send it. I shouldn't have let you go.


Thus, happy memories were bound to transform into sad nightmares. His gaze, fixed on the unmoving apparition of Grace, suddenly turned towards the window beyond. The bars that had been set to confine that woman were still there.



In the end, the one who was trapped was him. Leon Winston was indeed a life convict who had to live indefinitely trapped in the past with the Grace Lees.

Another day passed in captivity, marking the 1,053rd day without any incident.






Don't do it.


“Grace, give me a chance just this once.”


Shut up. I'm telling you to say exactly what you said when I was first caught trying to escape! Act like a monster driven mad by desire until the end!

I woke up from a dream, screaming like a madwoman. To my astonishment, I found that the area between my legs was wet. It was even more astonishing that my eyes were wet as well.

"Damn it…."


Grace muttered curses under her breath as she got up. She covered Ellie, who had kicked off the blanket all night, and quietly headed to the bathroom.

The sound of water echoed against the bathroom wall. And soon after, a suppressed groan followed the sound of water.



"Haah, heh...."


Grace sat in the bathtub with her legs wide apart, rubbing between her legs with her hands. Her face was flushed, but her expression was closer to one of anger. The movements of her hands, which were meant to soothe her body, were rough and more about calming her irritation than anything else.


"Ha, really…."


I decided to resolve it myself and stop suffering through that man's dreams due to my damn lust.


"I'm crazy...."


If I were to experience the final act again in a dream, I would have some understanding of it.


"Why, of all things... Really, ah, I'm going crazy, ugh."


The moment her fingers hit the tip, a thrill surged through her, and as she reached the climax, Grace hurriedly covered her mouth. The door was locked, but the sensitive-eared Ellie might wake up.

"Haa...."


As the pleasure ebbed away like a receding tide, Grace leaned her head against the edge of the bathtub and let out a long sigh. In reality, it didn't provide the relief she had expected.


Something was lacking.
The words that I would only miss that man's belongings were just a provocation, but now I had no choice but to admit that it had become my true feelings.

I should have really cut it.


I couldn't help but chuckle at the ridiculous thought.


“You won’t be missed.”


But at the moment the smile faded, the expression the man had made from what followed lingered before my eyes.


Ellie kicked off the blanket again. Grace lay next to her daughter, pulling the blanket up and silently lamenting.


"Eli, Mom must be crazy. Oh my gosh… why do you resemble that man so much…."


Ellie squeezed her eyes shut so that her face would not be visible, but she still tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep. In the pitch-black view, the events of this evening at the hotel kept flashing in her mind.

What lingered in my mind was precisely the gaze of that man from my imagination.


If there had been anger or desire blazing in his eyes, Grace might have rebelled against Norman and sought revenge. But why, of all places, did I remember the moment at Abington Beach when I called him a filthy pig?

No. Why did I recall that gaze?


Grace asked the man of my imagination.


Leon Winston, what do I feel for you?


It was a question you should have asked me.


The upscale restaurant behind the parliament was bustling with members of the noble council having lunch after the last meeting before the year-end recess. At one table in the midst of it all, the duke's family and the count's family were seated facing each other.



Leon thought that the one who chose the time and place where numerous noble eyes were focused on the gathering of both families was undoubtedly a weak Grand Duke.

"Count, when did you say your movie is coming out?"


In what way is that my movie? Leon replied nonchalantly.


"I don't know about that. You might want to check the poster on the street."


"The Count is so busy that he doesn't have the time to worry about such trivial matters."


The mother sitting next to me interrupted with a hearty laugh.


"The release is on Christmas Eve."


"Oh, there are two weeks left."


"Isn't that day also the third anniversary of the Count becoming the hero who saved the kingdom? You must have heard from Rosalyn that there is a special screening in Prescott tomorrow?"

A faint look of discomfort was visible on the Grand Duke's face as he nodded. The more his mother kept quiet, the further the topic strayed from the purpose of the author mentioning the movie.

The duke briefly left his seat to greet another member. The mother, who must have felt relieved to momentarily escape the pressure of the duke's marriage, would not have known that there was a spy among the allies.

“It has been more than three years since we got engaged, so it’s about time.”


As my younger sibling struggled to make it sound casual while slicing the venison on the plate, I truly found it impressive. Jerome was trying to hasten his marriage to his brother in order to gain a legitimate reason to live under the same roof as his lover.



"To keep Her Highness the Grand Princess unmarried for a long time is honestly not only a matter of etiquette..."


"I'm okay."


The princess sitting next to me spoke with a voice that crept in, feigning modesty. My mother shot Jerome a disapproving look but said nothing. There was indeed no fault in what the second son said.

"There are rumors circulating in social circles and the media that are unfavorable to the reputations of both families..."



"That's right. It's not good for the successor either."


Suddenly, Leon, who had been silent until now, interrupted.


"Let's hold the wedding. Your Highness the Grand Duchess, how about next spring?"


Even though he said he would grant her wish, his fiancée did not respond. His younger sister's face turned ashen.


Why? Why do you have that expression when I said I would let you both marry as you wish? Smile.


However, the only person smiling at this table was Leon. It was because he had insisted on hastening the marriage under the pretext of needing an heir.

"I want to embrace a successor as soon as possible. Now that I think about it, I don't believe I've had such a conversation with Your Highness. How many children do you think would be good to have? To be honest, I would like to have enough to form a polo team."



To say that he dislikes children while having four of them. When his mother looked at him with disbelief at the words coming out of his mouth, Leon smiled with a curl at the corner of his eye.

"I also didn't know until recently that I really like children."


I could vividly feel a slight tremor around my eyes and mouth.



“Ah... but Your Excellency…”
"Articles mentioning that the wedding is imminent are clearly being released by the Dae-Gong family."


No, it’s the second son, who is shamelessly crossing his arms with his mother right now, that is causing this.


Perhaps the reason Grace still hasn't responded to his provocation is that Jerome keeps spreading rumors about an impending marriage. I wanted to shut down the media company Jerome has and make sure that guy never sets foot in the media industry again, but I held off because he might be very useful later.


"The grand princess is increasingly unsatisfied. She seems to be more interested in physics than in becoming the matriarch of the family."



"It's astronomy."


"The fact that the knowledge learned by men and men of learning is no different, Jerome."


Jerome interrupted and corrected the mistake, touching his mother's pride. It seemed he had also triggered the firing pin of her nagging.



"Why are you doing this?"


"What have I done?"


"Why are you fawning over the Grand Duke like this? It's been ages since our family's status changed, and you're acting this way? I never thought I would have to say this, but Jerome, please try to emulate your brother."

Rather, the hell of the annex is better.


This is also hell. Leon sighed. Enduring these people from the car to the townhouse was hell.


And the premiere too.


He thought that only hell would be waiting for him tomorrow as well.










The department store was bustling with those preparing Christmas gifts. It was the time when I was holding a child's hand while getting off the crowded elevator, packed like sardines. A clerk blocked Grace's way and yelled.

“Please gift the toy of the year chosen by Princess Elizabeth to your lady's princess as well!”



What the clerk pointed to was a dollhouse. It was a huge and extravagant dollhouse that reached up to Grace's
"Were you able to buy Ellie? I should buy another one."


"I'm not going. Ellie doesn't have a hanabakke."


“Wow, are you lying? Santa Claus, Ellie said you lied.”


While they were tussling, it was Ellie's turn. Grace took several pictures of Ellie sitting on Santa's lap with a big smile, using the camera she had brought. The thought that Ellie's crescent -shaped eyes looked familiar crossed her mind every time she took a picture, and it grew stronger with each passing day.


"Yes, our little lady must have been a good girl this year, right?"


"Yes!"


Ellie nodded her head vigorously and looked at Grace. With a mix of pleading to answer that she was a good child and a hint of threat, she smiled and nodded her head.

"That's right. I haven't been sick at all this year, and I've eaten mushrooms, um, well. I was a good kid."


"Then you must be deserving of a Christmas gift. What would our little lady like to receive?"


In this way, parents discovered the gifts that their children want.


"Ellie...."


Seeing Ellie deep in thought made me feel emotional thinking about how much she has grown in just a year. Last year, she cried so much at the department store, thinking we were leaving her with a strange old man. When I asked her what kind of gift she wanted, she only asked for cookies.


"That!"


Grace, who was deeply immersed in her feelings, turned to the direction Ellie was pointing at and was astonished.


"Ellie."


Grace took the child to the corner and began to comfort him.


“Let’s do something else instead of that.”


"But Ellie is a princess."



Ellie pointed at the toy crown that she placed on my head and stomped her feet.
Grace, who ran to the center of the store calling the child's name, soon stopped and felt a sense of relief. As expected. The first guess turned out to be correct. Ellie was lingering in front of the dollhouse. But she wasn't alone; she was standing next to a blonde boy of her age, chatting excitedly.


“Ellie, I told you not to leave your mom's side.”


Ellie clung to the toy box in her mother's hands, unaware that her mom had just stepped into hell and then returned.



"I want to ride a horse!"


"Not before Christmas."


“Wah….”


Oh, I have to get out of this hell quickly. Grace pulled the tantrum-throwing child towards the elevator.


"Achus."


Ellie waved her hand to greet the boy. Just as she wondered why he was speaking the language of the Norden Kingdom, the boy waved his hand as well.

"Achus."


He was a Norden child.


“Mom, what is that?”


It was an illusion that coming out of the department store would be safe. As we walked to the tram station, Ellie pointed at a poster stuck to the wall of a building.

"Eh?"


I thought he was talking about my dad's movie poster, but he wasn't. In the colorful poster next to it, a clown was performing tricks on a horse while a magician was pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

"Circus."


When I explained it to the child who didn't know what it was, their eyes began to shine even more. Even if I can't buy a toy that costs half of a year's income, a circus is doable. So I asked the roadside kiosk, but why were all the tickets sold out?




"Ugh...."
"Ellie, could it be the boy we saw at the department store?"


"Wow, Matta!"


When Grace indicated the last place she saw the child, a police officer and a woman rushed to the department store to search for the child. Grace was about to leave when an elderly police officer sitting behind the desk took out a handful of candy from the drawer.



"The little interpreter has solved the case. The child who did a good deed should be rewarded."


"Wow!"


The moment Kyung-kwan stood up from the chair, Grace held her breath.


[Kidnapping]


A wanted poster with serious charges written in large letters caught my eye. From the suspect's appearance to the description of the abducted girl, and even the phone number for the Winsford area written at the bottom. There was no way I could not recognize that it was a poster looking for me.


"How old are you?"


"Two shals."


"What is your name?"


As the officer bent down in front of the child chewing on candy and asked a question, Grace suddenly lifted Ellie into her arms.



"Hello, it's Suzy. Thank you, I will do it."


The child sent a puzzled look to the mother and when urged once more, he willingly greeted.


"Thank you."


Damn it. I should have worn sunglasses.


Grace turned her body towards the door so that the officer couldn't see my and the child's eyes, and she began to speak.



"Um... I have a favor to ask."



"Yes, go ahead."
I was angry, yet at the same time exhilarated. It meant that he still couldn't forget her and was pursuing her.

Tomorrow, that man will come here. The thought that he has no idea that she is not far away made me scoff.


Grace placed the crumpled paper down and closed her handbag. She would burn this when she got home.


The flyer had to be stolen. It would be problematic if someone later saw this flyer and reported it using the number written here.



I won’t doubt it. I won’t even remember something like this.


The wanted poster had been hanging for quite some time, and the paper had turned yellow. Just like the missing person flyers that man used to distribute on the streets, people become desensitized to information that has been exposed for an extended period. The officers probably wouldn't even remember that there was such a poster in that spot. The fact that he had come and gone in Prescott City like it was his own home without getting caught by that man is proof of that.



It will be okay.


Grace struggled to soothe her increasingly anxious heart. In the past, she would have immediately left this place. However, now that Ellie had grown up, moving from their established home was out of the question, especially when there was no certainty that they had been discovered. Hoping desperately that nothing would happen, Grace hugged her daughter tightly.



"What happened?"


The officer, who was receiving an empty cup from the old woman and heading inside, asked when his subordinate, who had gone to the department store, returned.

"It was the child I was looking for."


"That's great."


The officer, who was heading to the lounge while nodding, stopped and asked.


“Where did the flyer that was over there go?”


"What kind of flyer are you talking about?"


"It's about the wanted kidnapper. They said the woman and the baby's eyes are turquoise, what nonsense, wait a minute...."



Suddenly stopping his speech and staring into the空, the officer's eyes widened.






[Shally?]


"It's Anna, Mrs. Tate. Sally has stepped out for a moment."


[Oh, really?]


“What is the matter?”


[The thing is, I won't be able to go to work today.]


Grace was shocked to hear the news, as she thought Mrs. Tate would have gone straight to the Paramount Theater since she was not going to work.

[...it was sharp and clear.]


Every morning, I go horseback riding, but I ended up with a broken leg due to a fall.


“Oh my, are you okay?”


[Oh, I feel really good right now. This feeling of floating on a cloud made of morphine is the best.]


The boss made a pointless joke and then gave instructions to Grace.


[So could you please let Mr. Grant know to take care of Sally instead of me today? Sally has fulfilled her wish after singing so much about wanting to see Count Winston.]

"Ah, yes. Haha... I’ll pass that on. Don't worry and get some rest."


[Okay, I'll ask you for a favor.]


Grace, who hung up the phone, returned to her seat after leaving a note with Mrs. Tate's instructions on her colleague's desk. She sighed deeply as she looked down at the guest list once more and picked up the receiver.

"This is the Grant Pictures president's office."


Then I gave the hotel number I found in the phone book to the operator. After that, there followed a long and anxious wait, until finally someone in the suite answered the call.

[Yes, where are you?]



It was a voice I had never heard before.
“Hello, this is Anna Snyder from the Grant Pictures President's Office.”


Pierce would never imagine that I was on the phone with Sally Bristol, whom I often encountered at the mansion.

Grace rattled off the prepared greetings.


“Despite your busy schedule, Grant Pictures would like to once again thank you for attending the special screening at the Winston family estate. Was your journey to Prescott City comfortable?”

[Yes, thanks to you.]


"I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything you are lacking at the hotel?"


[No, there isn't anything so far.]


[Yes, that's a relief. If you need anything, please feel free to ask any of our staff waiting in the hotel lobby...]


It was time to conclude the usual greetings and remind Pierce of today's schedule.


[Pierce! Bring me the phone right now!]


A familiar voice was heard on the other end of the receiver.


"Ana."


At that moment, the office door burst open and someone called out to me, causing Grace to instinctively scrunch her face and press the receiver even closer to her ear. As if that wasn't enough, she even gestured for them to be quiet.



To the boss.


[It is clear that the woman took the flyer.]


The informant to Campbell was an officer from the Prescott police station. He said that he found the number and reported it after the woman took the flyer, prompting him to inquire with police stations in other areas.

"Report every detail, no matter how trivial, from the moment she first entered the police station until she left."


[A woman came to the police station....]


Leon, who was listening carefully to the report from the officer, frowned at the mention that the child spoke Norrden.

"Really…."


Grace was at her wit's end.


"It was a mistake, Mr. Grant."


It was as if she was gesturing for the employer to go away in annoyance. The boss not only teased her all morning but even continued to chuckle in the car on the way to the theater.

"I apologize for the interruption caused by an old boss when I wanted to hear the voice of the young count, Mrs. Snyder."



A faint laugh was heard from the driver in the front seat. However, the expression on Norman's face, sitting in the passenger seat, was not very good.

It feels awkward. Grace turned her gaze out the car window. She hadn't thought that Norman always followed the boss.



In the end, I decided to throw away the note I had written to my colleague and go to the theater. After all, that man would only come in the evening, and she would finish work before then.

"Anna, since you are taking on the role of Mrs. Tate, why not attend the party today as well?"


It was a misunderstanding that the president had stopped teasing because he was making a serious suggestion.


"Let me introduce Count Winston. If you're going to hear his voice anyway, it would be better to see his face while listening."



"The dog…."


Grace, who almost made another mistake, quickly corrected herself.


"I didn't intend to hear the Count's voice."


I really wonder why I did that.


Grace pressed her hands against her throbbing temples and let out a sigh.


No, that's not it. Since there was also the incident at the police station yesterday, I was just trying to eavesdrop in case that man had found out something about me. However, Pierce really hung up the phone at that man's command, so I could no longer eavesdrop.




[Pierce! Bring me the phone right now!]
The boss was trying hard to lure her, seemingly intent on making her come to the party to get involved with the agent. However, she would have no idea that instead of bait, he was spraying her with a repellent.

"The count needs to see him in person. He's exceptionally handsome. He has the kind of face that women love. More suited to be an actor than a soldier…."

Grace pressed her throbbing temples and swallowed a sigh. She wished today would just end. Then she wouldn't have to suffer through that man's story anymore.

The staff preparing for the screening ran around the theater in a frantic manner. While others were so busy, Grace was embarrassingly at ease.

Until the interview, Mr. Grant will be chatting with the theater's owner. Moreover, the interview was conducted by the public relations officer, Norman. Still, since I don't know when the owner will be looking for me, I can't go far, and Grace looked around the theater while holding a cup of coffee.


It was only natural that I headed to the theater where the preview was being held today.


There's no one here.


When I entered the viewing area on the second floor, the thought I had was an illusion.


"Cough, cough…."


I heard the sound of coughing from the field. When I looked down from the second-floor railing, I saw a man in a blue work uniform standing alone in front of the stage on the first floor, adjusting the lighting at the edge of the stage.



Is the preparation here almost finished?


It was when I turned my body to go down to the first floor, looking at the enormous silver curtain in front of me.


Chalkang.


Grace's handbag buckle hit the railing. In that instant, the worker seemed to lift his head this way, then immediately pulled his hat down tightly. When I went down to the first floor of the theater, the worker was outside holding his tool bag, as if he had finished his work.



As soon as the laborer who had been coughing repeatedly left, silence finally descended. Grace, who was left alone in the enormous auditorium, perched between the spotlight beams at the edge of the stage and sipped her coffee. Her gaze was fixed on the seat in the center of the first row, where a nameplate that read Leon Winston was set up.


You probably don't even dream that I was here. Tonight, you are facing my traces.



Grace, who had been smiling while staring at the man from five hours later, suddenly frowned.
with serious expressions, was not kind. Knowing this, how could they be so lax with security?


“Anna, are you okay?”


"Yes?"


When Norman suddenly asked, Grace withdrew her gaze from the bosses she had been glaring at. Fortunately, it seemed they had not noticed her look. His attention was on Grace's hand grasping the napkin.

"You are shaking your hands."


“Roger, your employee's complexion has not been good since a little while ago.”


"Looks like Anna was very surprised."


It seems that the boss, trembling in fear, ordered a glass of brandy from the waiter.


"Good job, Anna. Everyone here right now…."


The president pointed with the end of the cigar in his hand at the employees who were gathered in small groups in the café, looking out the window with worried faces.

"Thanks to you all, everyone has been spared from tragedy. It's unfortunate about Mrs. Tate, but Anna coming in as a substitute today might just be the will of God."

"Isn't it the boss's intention to give a bonus to the employee who saved my life, haha?"


"Of course. This year, the employee who will receive the biggest Christmas bonus from Grant Pictures will be Anna Snyder. Anyway, thank you very much."

Of course, you should thank me, you monkeys wearing top hats.


Grace leaned her brandy glass brought by the waiter as she waited for the theater search to be over. It was around the time when the bottom of the glass became visible. The police chief and the commander of the bomb disposal team came to the café to report the search results to the managers.


“Four filled improvised bombs were found only near the center of the first row where the VIP seats are gathered. Since there are none in other locations, it seems they were not targeting the entire audience.”

"It was only targeting the count."


The alcohol shattered in an instant. Grace knew better than anyone the destructive power of the bomb that was filled with nails. If he had not discovered it, that man would have certainly died in agony and misery so severe that it would have been considered a blessing from the divine.

Grace replied calmly. It's not entirely wrong either.


“Then I should go to the hotel and try to persuade the Count's family.”


The president stood up from his seat and gestured for Grace to get up.


“Anna, let's go. If you see the count's face, you'll completely forget the shock from just a moment ago.”


"Ah, I..."


Grace's hand trembled slightly.


"I'm still too nervous to get up."


“Oh dear.... Waiter! Another glass of brandy here!”


As soon as the executives and Norman left, the trembling of my hands completely stopped.


7:50 AM.


Standing in front of the mirror, Leon fastened the cuffs on the sleeves of his shirt and, noticing the time on his wristwatch, headed toward the window. The theater, located two blocks away, was still flashing brightly on the electronic billboard.



It meant that there was no bomb that had not been found.


The bomb planted by the remnants was a time bomb set to explode around 7:30 when the movie was in full screening.



So, we agreed with the film company to start the premiere an hour and a half late. In the meantime, if a bomb went off, the premiere would be canceled on its own.

"Was there no call from Roger Grant?"


Leon asked Pierce for confirmation as he inserted his arms into the tuxedo jacket held by one of the attendants.


"Not yet."


"That's too bad."


I wasn't particularly interested in the preview from the beginning, but after hearing the good news this morning, all interest has completely disappeared. I want to stay at the hotel and monitor the progress, but even if he does, there

Leon buttoned his jacket and lifted his gaze. The face reflected in the window was far from that of a happy person who had heard news of Grace and their daughter after two years.

It's the first opportunity in two years. The next one might be in ten years. If there is a next one.


Leon warned himself in the reflection in the window.


If you miss this, you will not be a living corpse but a rotting corpse.


I have been living a life for three years where short hopes are followed by long despair. Therefore, hope no longer feels like hope.



Taking the flyer means that he is already aware that he is being tracked. Leon hoped that this time the child would slow the woman's pace, and he followed the attendants out of the bedroom.

"Send someone to the theater as soon as new information is received."


“Yes, Colonel.”


He urged Campbell, who was saluting, and stepped outside the suite.


Currently, half of the special task force's personnel were searching for checks issued by women at department stores, with amounts matching the prices of toys. The other half were on their original mission, tracking down remnants of the rebel forces. It was not pleasing to have to divide the personnel called in to track Grace and the child for the purpose of pursuing the rebels.



I have dedicated my whole life to chasing someone. Suddenly, that thought crossed my mind. Normally, I would have let out a snicker, but now, not even a smile came to me.

Grace, standing in the corner of the theater lobby, watched the entrance. She was still armed with sunglasses and a scarf. The hand tucked into her coat pocket was gripping the handle of a pistol.

At the entrance, soldiers were thoroughly conducting body searches on those entering. Distrusting them, Grace pretended to wait for the manager while checking the faces of those coming in. She knew the faces of the rebels better than anyone here.



Fortunately, no unwelcome faces have appeared so far.


Why the hell is that bastard saying he's coming?


I have been holding back all day, wanting to call the hotel and warn them not to attend the preview.



Does your life count for ten?
"How about the count?"


“I don't want to see you.”


The manager burst into laughter at the quick response.


"Enjoy the movie. Make sure to come to the party after you've watched it. Your outfit is fine as it is, so please do come."



At that moment, while the president was saying something unnecessary, cheers were heard from below. Grace's face turned cold as she looked down.

Leon Winston walked into Grace's line of sight after two years.


With one arm extended to the grand princess.


Seeing the elegant black tuxedo reminded me of the day of the engagement ceremony when that man had me serve him.



It must have looked like that that day too.


Grace suppressed the feelings that shouldn't exist for me and searched for the familiar emotions.


In the midst of a flood of flashes that were incomparable to before, his platinum hair, slicked back with pomade without a strand out of place, shone even brighter. Because he was standing right below her, his face was not clearly visible, but it was obvious that he was smiling.


It was just as it appeared in the media, happy and perfect.


How could this happen? How is this possible?


The hand gripping the railing trembled slightly. At the moment the man turned at the landing while ascending the stairs with the Grand Duchess, Grace turned her back.

“Oh my, Lady Tate's words were really true? If I were a grand duchess, I would have been so captivated that I would have already tripped over my own feet.”

Her colleague chattered away, unaware of her pace.


"Your Excellency, please come this way."


Due to the incident earlier today, the VIP seats were moved to the second floor. As we followed Grant's guidance to the center of the first row on the second floor, the audience on the first floor stood up and applauded Leon.

The story of Major Richard Winston’s happy days, just before his tragic death, was unfolding on the screen, featuring a thirteen -year-old Leon Winston. He did not resemble the image Grace remembered, which made her feel uncomfortable. So, she waited for the childhood story to end while looking not at the screen but at the back of her own head.



I didn't want the few happy memories from my childhood to be distorted. It was a ridiculous and miserable thing.


[Leon, the one who laughs last is the ultimate victor.]


The moment such a line was said, Leon frowned. His father had never said anything like that.


He who laughs last is the ultimate victor.


On the day this war, where both sides stake everything they have, comes to an end, who will be the last one standing? He wondered, unaware that the woman who is both the adversary and target of this war was in the same space, asking the same question.



[Blow! Hurry up and blow!]


[Ugh!]


As the scene depicting that night at Abington Beach unfolded, both of them closed their eyes. Grace also covered her ears, but the terrible sound not only did not stop but grew even clearer. What resonated in her ears was the sound she had heard that night.



It was rather a time when I was trying to cover the screams in my head with the sounds coming from outside, removing my hands from my ears.

[Father!]


The boy's heart-wrenching scream was heard.


Did you cry out like that when you first saw your cold father? Perhaps you came looking for me, who would never arrive no matter how long you waited, only to discover a corpse.

At that moment when such thoughts suddenly occurred to me, my heart sank. When the face of the boy crying out in front of his father's corpse overlapped with Eli's face, I was even left breathless.

Once I had a child, I began to see that day from a new perspective. The thirteen-year-old boy, who seemed so much like an adult at the time, now looked like a mere child. The child, who must have suffered an unbearable shock, could only become a monster blinded by a desire for revenge. And I could also understand that the arrows of that revenge would inevitably be directed at me.




We were all inexperienced. The adults were even more inexperienced.
her, the man had said these words.


"I was born a noble, will live as a monster, and will die as a hero."


Then, she brought her lips close to her ear and whispered.


“Then I want to live as an ordinary man.”


What followed that remark was sarcasm.


"That's crazy noise."


"Do you know well?"


It was a drunken rant. From death to the next life. It really wasn't like Leon Winston.


Anyway, today Leon Winston realized his dream of becoming a hero. So, is it time for him to die in order to achieve his next goal of wanting to live as an ordinary man?

Should I have let you die?


Staring at the back of the man's head without flinching, Grace sneered.


You are a hero, but what am I?


Naturally, she didn't even appear in the movie. At a celebration party honoring the hero who cleared away the blood -stained past and opened a new era, the nameless hero was merely an unwanted guest. Grace stood up and went outside.



The movie being a mess was not solely due to the king's involvement. The story that Leon provided to the screenwriter was 20% true and 80% fiction. And Grace was not in that story. Because that woman is one who does not exist in the records.



So people will not know. The real heroes of that day were the Grace Lee's. And the true loser of that day was Leon Winston.



The theme of the ridiculous movie brutally recreated the appearance of Blackburn village. As she got off the bus and the entrance to the village she had disappeared into came into view, Leon's vision blurred.

If I had held on at that moment, every moment of the past three years would have been different.


[Do you know what the most cruel revenge is?]



Leon answered the self in the movie.
Even the man whom the whole world believes to be the ultimate winner might call that movie an absurd piece of junk, completely different from his perspective.

By the way, whose perspective was this decision made from?


Fortunately for Grace, all the rebels appearing in the scene of torture and death were men. It made me wonder whose decision it was to exclude 'Angela Reidle' from the film. Even if it was that man's decision, it might not have been to consider her, but rather to protect his father's honor.


I was actually curious if it was for the same reason that I didn't appear.


Today, Grace, recalling the man she saw with her own eyes, smiled with a sense of emptiness. The exhilaration I felt from still searching for me and Ellie vanished like a mirage the moment I saw Leon Winston's utterly relaxed demeanor on the red carpet.



I wonder why I distorted that man in my mind without restraint. There was no sign of danger at all, like in my imagination or dreams.



I was going to laugh at you heartily if you ended up as a mountain corpse.


For no reason, wanting to confirm something that wasn’t even there with my eyes, I ended up recalling the time around that man’s engagement. From the small incident that happened on his father’s memorial day to the moment I met my biological father, and eventually to the fact that I came to have Ellie. Looking back, that period was a significant turning point.



"I should give her to my daughter...."


Grace, feeling inexplicably melancholic, muttered to herself as she gathered juice bottles, cookies, and a box of chocolates from the table and placed them into her handbag. Imagining Ellie’s face lit up with joy at the sight of this uplifted her spirits.



It was the moment when I was about to go out, cradling a handbag that had become so heavy that I wondered if the shoulder strap would break.

"Yes, Your Excellency."


The voice of the guard standing in the hallway outside could be heard.


"The lounge is this way."


As soon as she quickly hid behind the folding partition in the corner of the lounge, the door opened. Although she hadn't heard it in three years, the familiar footsteps still echoed in as she strained to listen and held her breath.


Please don't come this way.
That's nonsense.


She slowly turned her head. When she placed her eyes on the gap where the partition folds, she saw a man sitting alone on a leather sofa. Again, she couldn't see his face. Because it was buried in a white cloth.

That…


It was a bonnet adorned with a pink ribbon and lace frills. The more surprising thing than the fact that the bonnet Ellie had discarded two years ago was in that man's hands was that his shoulders were shaking.

"Please..."


Grace repeatedly told herself to try to overlook the fact that the voice of pleading was soaked in emotion.


It's smiling. That's smiling. It has to be smiling.


"I'm glad. Right, Ellie?"


Grace stared blankly at Eli's face, who was fast asleep in the darkness, and murmured. It seems the officer didn't recognize us. If they had received a tip, that man wouldn't have done such a thing in the lounge.

Then it seems I can keep living here.


"I'm glad."


Alright. So now sleep peacefully. Grace closed her eyes, trying to reassure herself, but after a little while, she opened her eyes wide again. As soon as she did, she let out a painful sigh and turned over.

Suddenly, the sharp nails densely filling the bomb came to mind. I don't know whose doing it was, but it came a step too late. For that man, the nails called Grace Lee were already deeply embedded, having sprouted roots that reached Ellie.



I have fulfilled my wish to become a nail that is embedded in that man's heart for a lifetime. Then I should be happy.



"Haa..."


It might be an illusion that it sounded like a sigh even though I laughed.


Grace, be happy. You must be happy.


The sound of laughter and clinking crystal glasses harmonized like a chord with the lively jazz piano melody.



In the middle of the party, while people danced relentlessly in a way that would have made my mother look on with
"I imagined a more mature name, like Eva, rather than Sally."


"Oh my, you were curious about my name? Oh dear, how wonderful. It feels like a dream. Actually, I wanted to change my name because I thought it sounded like a rustic country girl or a maid."

“Please don't forget to include Eva as a candidate for the new name.”


"Yes! It is truly an honor, Your Excellency."


Sure, it must be an honor for you to have casually used that woman's name in your subject all this time.


As Leon raised the cup again and tilted it, Grant scanned the area around the two employees with his eyes and asked.



"By the way, where did Anna go?"


The employees shrugged as if they didn't know.


"Oh dear, he has already run away. Anyway, he sure knows how to make a quick escape."


Leon tilted his glass and smiled. He knew that she was exceptionally good at slipping away.


"About Anna."


As the staff greeted and stepped back, Grant leaned against the table and began to ramble on with unnecessary chatter again.



“He is an exceptional employee who pressures the president just to hear your voice. In fact, he is a precious talent more suited to being an actor than a clerical worker, so I was determined to bring him today and introduce him to the agents…”



Grant let out a sound of disappointment, and Leon continued with words that showed no interest.


"This young lady, oh, she is not a young lady…. Anyway, this friend has the eyes of an actor. If there is one regret, it

is that the mysterious color of those captivating eyes cannot be shown in the film…."


In that moment, the light blue eyes reflected an unexpected charm on the slanted crystal glass. Leon immediately set down the glass and uttered a word.

“Turquoise.”


Grant made a silly face and asked.



"How did you know?"
Image



























As I opened the door to the secretary's office and walked in, a colleague who had arrived first saw Grace's face and remarked in place of a greeting that she looked tired.

“Did your daughter wake you up at the crack of dawn again today?”


"Uh? Uh…."


In fact, I couldn't sleep a wink all night, just tossing and turning.


"Did nothing special happen yesterday?"


Grace asked as she sat in front of the desk.


"Two people broke their legs after falling while just dancing on the party table. Is this enough?"


You threw quite a wild party, didn't you? Grace smiled as she opened her notebook, which had her tasks for today organized.



"Confirmation and farewell for the distinguished guests' checkout…"


"Everyone will probably be late because of a hangover."


I also remembered a colleague who was holding their forehead, saying they were dying from a hangover.


"Winston has already checked out. Norman and Mr. Grant will take care of the farewell to the train station, so he

cast his gaze at Campbell rather than them.


"I have confirmed my attendance at work."


Leon then headed towards the sofa and nodded. It's surprising she hasn't run away yet. Considering the testimony that she was lurking around him yesterday, it seems that woman has become quite lax over time.

Just as he sat on the sofa, Campbell reported one more thing.


"I have also identified the boarding location."


"Good. You've worked hard."


It was the news he had been waiting for the most. His nerves should have relaxed, but they only became tenser.

Leon picked up the coffee cup that was placed on the table.


After nearly finishing his drink, he still asked the two men standing in front of him.


"Do you have any business?"


Grant bowed while holding a fedora in his hand and babbled incoherently.


"Family members, we have seen them off well. I would like to express my greetings with that statement... I apologize if it caused any inconvenience."

Leon shook his head as he set down his coffee cup. As he leaned against the back of the sofa and raised his gaze, he met the eyes of a young man who turned pale. Leon lifted the corners of his mouth. That woman, she still couldn't forget him, and her habit of choosing men who didn't resemble him was unchanged. It was because of that that he couldn't help but smile even while facing the guy who had dared to lay his hands on his woman.


"By the way, did you say Norman? Don't forget what I said yesterday."


Norman froze at the count's nonchalant remark as he checked his wristwatch. It was the memory of what had happened here last night that caused it.

"The things that happened with that woman, the fact that I asked about her, the moment any story about her spreads..."



The count I faced alone last night was not the hero I had seen in the media. Although I was in a private meeting with the count, I felt a level of fear comparable to being surrounded by dozens of gang members pointing their guns at me and threatening me.



It was the time when I was inwardly resenting the president for blabbering to the count about the date with that woman. The count said something like this.

Hazel Brook Village Hall.


The station mentioned by the driver passed by Leon's eyes. The car stopped in front of a building after passing the town hall. Campbell, who got out of the passenger seat, opened the back door, and Leon took out a pair of dark sunglasses from his pocket and went outside. On the fence of the one-story building, where the voices of children could be faintly heard, there was a plaque that read.



Hazel Brook Daycare.


"Is this it?"


"Yes, there is no other daycare in this town besides here."


Leon nodded and passed straight through the fence into the building. The teacher he met at the entrance asked him what he was there for with a puzzled look, but when he said he came to pick up a child, she readily let him in.

From children running around laughing, to those standing still and looking up at a stranger with curious eyes. He checked for his daughter among the children of the same age, but she was not there.

Blond hair and turquoise eyes. It's not a trivial feature that one could overlook, but could it be that I can't even recognize my own daughter?



While Leon was scanning the interior, he absentmindedly turned his head to the window and saw his last hope. On this cold day, there were children playing in the playground in the backyard. As soon as he stepped out into the backyard, a boy shouted to his friend.



“Princess, let's play hide and seek!”


“Wait. I'm going to eat all of this and then play.”


A curt reply came back, as if giving an order to a subordinate. Captivated by a strange intuition, Leon took off his sunglasses, which felt cumbersome, and turned his head towards the direction of the girl's voice.

At that moment, my heart reacted before my head. It was ridiculous to worry that I might not recognize them.


The girl with bright blonde hair, like Leon's, sat with her back turned on a low-hanging branch of a tree, wearing a toy crown. Just like a daisy on an orange tree.

This is my daughter.


A tingling excitement began to swirl from my fingertips. The brief moment of approaching the child felt longer than the past three years it took to come here.


My princess is only three steps away. Just two steps, just one step. And now, she is close enough to embrace.
Leon gently embraced his daughter, who seemed so small that she might break if touched, yet on the other hand, had grown too big for him to catch up with. He then whispered in her ear the words he had practiced for a long time.



"Nice to meet you, Ellie. I'm your dad."


"I hate it."


The child standing with crossed arms shook their head firmly.


"Mom said not to follow strangers."


"He's not a stranger uncle, you know?"


The major was putting in effort to persuade his two-year-old who was not even half his size. For Campbell, who thought the major would forcibly take the child and lock him up in a hotel, this was an unexpected situation.

From the appearance of the hair to the eyes, nose, and mouth. It's undeniable that they share the same bloodline at a glance, but the child did not believe that the Major was his father.

"Should I ask what that man is saying?"


The major suddenly pointed at Campbell, and the child cast a confused glance at him. Campbell also became bewildered, as it seemed the major was staring at him with the eyes of a rebel.

"Yes, it is obvious that they are father and daughter."


"Did you hear? They say he looks like that uncle."


Leon would often explain in simple terms to the child who did not understand what father-and-son relations meant, and he even asked the little ones gathered around him.

"Is that Ellie’s dad? That’s nice."


"What is it? Is that guy really their dad? Liar!"


“Wow, it's totally the same.”


"Look at this. They say friends resemble each other?"



"No!"
"Is he your father? But surely Ellie’s mother is…."


Grace must have lied that Ellie’s father passed away like in the workplace.


"I don't know what my wife said, but it's just a separation."


It's not wrong. Leon still passed by the dazed teacher and took Ellie out of the daycare.


"Are you going to my house?"


I thought that the child had come out because I said we should go see mom, but as soon as the child got in the car, they asked like this. Leon was planning to call Grace after going to the hotel, but the moment the child said "our house," his thoughts changed.



The only person who knew the location of the house was the child, who said they had only been there on foot. The driver drove the car slowly, at a pace worse than walking, following the child's directions.

"Ppuuu haejyo. Kya ha, again! Do it again!"


The child, excited about riding in a car for the first time, kept urging the driver to honk the horn. Surprisingly, her lack of shyness and her quirky nature were just like her mother when she was little. Thanks to this, it took 10 minutes to reach the apartment, which was less than a minute away by car.


It appeared to be a recently constructed building due to its tidy exterior. Leon had Campbell and the driver wait in front of the building and followed the child inside.

"This is our home."


The place where the child proudly shouted and stopped was in front of a door on the fourth floor. Leon, who entered by unlocking the door with the key hanging around the child's neck, was left speechless.

The house was much smaller than he expected. He thought it would be larger than the house in the South where Grace had given birth to and raised the child, given how big the child had grown. It was a thought he had vaguely at the time, but it was hard to believe that everything necessary for a family's life could fit into a space smaller than his guest bedroom.



Leon, who opened the only room's door, was once again at a loss for words, but he barely composed himself and asked the child rummaging through the toy basket in the living room.

"Where does Ellie sleep?"


"Over there."



A hand buried in the basket emerged and pointed to the bedroom where Leon was standing.
I had come to check how you’ve been living. Then I was planning to take the child to the hotel, but somehow it turned out like this.



"It's time for the baby to eat."


The child sat him down on the living room sofa and, telling him to feed ‘Muffin’ milk, handed him a doll and a toy bottle, then gleefully wandered around the house, making little sounds. Leon's eyes did not leave the child, who was constantly moving.



I still can't believe that my daughter is in front of him. It feels like it might be the most ecstatic yet cruel dream that barbiturates have given me.

"Wait a moment. Ellie will bring the car."


The child rummaged through the playbox, saying they would bring out the car. Then, they ran to the kitchen with their little feet and brought back a box of chocolates.

I laugh, speak, and walk. Every action my child takes is fascinating. It's something that any human would do, yet seeing my child do it is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Even the two eyes and ten fingers that any human possesses are remarkable to me.



It was certainly so small that one could not even feel its stirring at some point. The last time I saw it, the child could neither talk nor walk, but now it could take off its shoes and coat and know how to tidy them up by itself.

On top of that, you can speak a foreign language.


“Ellie.”


"Excuse me?"


"Where did you learn Norse?"


The child looked up at him and tilted his head. It seemed he didn't know what Norse was. So when he asked where the child learned this word in Norse, the child happily replied in Norse. He learned it from his neighbor.

Neighbor? Surely they didn't escape to Norden?


"Then where did you live with your mom before coming here?"


“Uh….”


The child thought for a while and then described the characteristics of where I lived. When taking a deep breath, there was a smell of salt, and in the morning, a large white bird with a yellow beak sat side by side by the window.

that short time, as the bonnet looked small.


“Ugh, it’s frustrating.”


The child threw off the bonnet in a tantrum and tossed it onto his lap. This child was the one who had thrown off the bonnet at the harbor. A tender smile spread across Leon's face.

"Are you bored?"


The child asked like that and then started rummaging under the side table next to the sofa. I wondered what they were doing, and they were struggling to pull out a thick book. When Leon took it out for them, the child placed it on his lap.



"Did you see baby Eli when he was little? Didn’t see? If you’re bored, you can see baby Eli."


What the child gave was an album. And then, she raised her finger long over her lips and whispered as if it were a secret.



"Ellie is no longer a baby, so don't tell mom. Mom thinks Ellie is still a baby."


It's a baby, isn’t it? Leon burst into laughter and lightly pinched the child's soft cheek.


The child began rummaging through the toy basket again, and Leon, glancing down at the album with a contented smile, tightened his face as soon as the name written on the cover caught his eye.

Elizabeth?


"Ellie."


"Uh?"


"Is your name Elizabeth?"


"Yes!"


The back of his neck felt tightly pulled. Leon murmured through clenched teeth.


"Your mom really…."


"Mom, you're really pretty!"



“…That's true.”
“Can Dad take this?”


"No way. That's Mom's."


"What about this?"


"That's not even it."


Feeling a sense of stubbornness from the continued rejections, he grabbed the child and sat them on his lap, asking.



"Then what about Ellie?"


"Mom, go away, of course!"


The child was disappointingly resolute. Then, while staring at Leon's face, she added this remark and jumped down from his lap.



"Instead, Dad will do it for Ellie."


I called him Dad. That wasn't enough, he said it was his. I wonder where he learned the fox-like behavior of patting me on the back right after striking my heart. While Leon chewed on his daughter's words dozens of times, the child became absorbed in playing house once more.


"Ja. Eat deliciously!"


After a while, a humble yet precious tea table was set up on the small coffee table in his life.


"What do you want to drink?"


"Coffee?"


"There's nothing like that. Drink strawberry tea."


The child tilted the teapot toward the toy teacup and offered it to him. Leon accepted the empty teacup. Feeling the unspoken pressure of the child watching with sparkling turquoise eyes full of expectation, he awkwardly tilted the empty cup.



"Did you drink?"


"Yes."



"Then eat the cake that Ellie baked."
"Elly, did you want Daddy?"


"Yes."


"So, does Dad have your heart?"


The child looked at him, shyly sucking their finger, then nodded. It was so endearing that it felt like my breath would stop.



"Has there ever been a time when Dad was at Ellie’s house? Have you ever called another man Dad?"


If anyone dares to hear the word "dad" from his daughter, I will put a bullet in their ear.


"Has another uncle ever come?"


The child shook their head in response to all three questions. Leon whispered while kissing the child's cheek.


“Good job, my daughter.”


I have already confirmed that there are no male belongings in the house. When Ellie confirmed through her own words that Grace had never let another man into her and the child's life, Leon felt a sense of relief.

"When mom comes, dad keeps saying he wishes he could stay at Ellie’s house. It's a promise."


"Promise."


Already listening to Dad so well. There was no angel like you.


"Should I call Mom too?"


"No, Mom has to work."


Leon hugged the child even tighter. He couldn't help but know that this peaceful and happy time would come to an end with Grace's arrival. He wanted to experience the time she had spent alone with the child.

"Have you ever heard Mom talk about Dad?"


"Yes."



"What did you say?"
I envied Grace, who could buy the precious love of a child with a poor love. I wanted to know what kind of love he should pour out to catch up with the child’s life, which he had entered late.

His gaze, wandering around, landed on a small fir tree in the corner of the living room. Beneath the tree, decorated with colorful ribbons, stars, and beads, lay three or four carefully wrapped gift boxes.

"Ellie, is that the gift that mom bought for you?"


The child nestled in his arms nodded.


"But Mom said I shouldn't open it. Why not? Really not allowed?"


The child kept asking why it wouldn't work and obtained permission from him to open it. He became curious about whom this trick resembled. Sensing that if he said it was okay to open it, he would have to face both the child's delight and the woman's fist, Leon asked the child.


"Ellie, should Dad buy you a gift too? You can open what Dad gives you today."


If you’re Winston, you must also be shaped by desire. As expected, the child’s teal-colored eyes began to sparkle.


"Betty's dad said he would buy a puppy."


"Just a puppy?"


As I mocked, Eli's eyes sparkled even brighter. Leon made a decisive move.


“Ellie, Dad can buy you anything you want.”


"Everything?"


The child's eyes grew wider and then smiled brightly as if they wanted something. It resonated.










"Ellie was taken by her father in the morning."


"Yes?"



Eli's dad? Who on earth?
It was only a moment that I felt joy seeing that they were safe. Watching the child, who only knew their mother, comfortably nestled in the arms of their father for the first time today, felt like the world was collapsing.

What kind of trick did you pull on Ellie?


Grace looked around the room and gritted her teeth. That son of a bitch changed the kid's clothes into pajamas as if he were something special and put them down for a nap. On the side table, there was a storybook that the man must have read to the child, placed next to his wristwatch and cufflinks.


Not only did I invade her house without permission, but I also intruded into her territory as a mother. It was just as unforgivable as kidnapping a child.

"Get up."


Grace approached the bed and pressed the muzzle of the gun against the sleeping man's forehead. He inhaled deeply and let out a low groan before opening his eyes. Was he not just pretending to sleep? The man looked up at her with eyes heavy with sleep, and after a long moment of gazing that sparked annoyance, he grinned.


“Hello, Mrs. Snyder.”


A deep, immersed voice flowed out from between skillfully curved lips.


"By the way, since when has my surname been Snyder?"


Where are you being foolish? Grace grabbed the collar of a man's shirt, with a couple of buttons undone, with one hand. To ensure that Ellie, still wandering in Dreamland, couldn't hear, she whispered through clenched teeth while staring into his eyes right in front of her.



"Get up quietly and get lost right now. Just like always, you are quietly disappearing from my life and my daughter's."



However, the man came out brazenly as always.


“Shh, quietly.”


She pressed her finger against her lips and with the other hand, she patted the restless child. It was astonishing.


"He's a sensitive child. He'll wake up. The first thing he sees when he opens his eyes is his mother trying to kill his father. It's not good for his upbringing. Go out and resolve it through conversation."

Watching my daughter sink deeper into the man's embrace in her sleep, I felt both frustration and helplessness at the same time. That man knew all too well that I wouldn't be able to even fight him, let alone shoot him, in front of Ellie.




So this time, you started by finding Ellie to take her hostage.
way to drive out the man who had taken up residence in her home. She had imagined being caught by this man countless times, but she never imagined that he would be sitting in her house.

In the end, while burying his face in his hands in despair, the man acted as if he could read his thoughts again.


"You don't need to run away. I'm not trying to force you to go."


When I raised my head at the unmanly sound, the man looked around the house and made even more absurd noises.



"I wonder if I should live here too."





“At first, I wondered how one could live in such a cramped space, but it’s quite cozy. The sleep that never came on my bed, which costs the price of a car, comes easily on your modest bed. It’s fascinating.”

"Then get out with the bed right now."


The man burst into laughter as if he had heard a funny joke. But who is actually the one telling the joke? A joke that isn't even funny.



"Grace, I'm a more progressive man than I appear. While you bring in the money, I'll stay at home and raise our daughter."



"Crazy bastard."


“Profanity is prohibited at home. Our daughter is listening.”


He pointed at Grace with his finger as if to warn her, glancing at the closed bedroom door. As she was at a loss for words, the man uncrossed his legs and suddenly stood up.

As I grabbed the handgun that had been placed on the table, the man smiled and walked this way. With a rattle, the chair across from her was pulled in, and he sat down opposite her with only the small table between them.

"I'll stop with the silly jokes. There's no need to be that cautious of me. If I truly intended to take Ellie away, I would have had plenty of time to do so while you were trapped at the company. And if I had intended to trap you, I wouldn't even attempt to have a conversation."



Grace just glared without answering. Her hand was still aiming a gun at him beneath the table.


“I just want to make up for the mistakes I've made like an adult now.”


In your arrogant and selfish way. The moment the man clasped his hands and looked at her seriously, he spoke again, the prediction came true.

"I know, Grace."


The man reached out his hand to wrap around Grace's trembling fist.


"I think you are amazing for raising Ellie wonderfully while struggling alone. What I want to say is, why are you trying to suffer for no reason?"

"What's useless is not the hardships, but you."


As soon as she was touched, she shook it off and stood up.


"As you said, I can raise Ellie wonderfully without you, so could you please just leave now that you are unnecessary?"



I opened the front door and waved my hand outside as if to see them off.


"Goodbye. I was uncomfortable seeing you after such a long time. I hope we never meet again."


As expected, the man did not budge. After staring at Grace blankly and letting out a quiet sigh, he opened his mouth again with a voice that was lower than before.

“I think you were displeased that I brought up the money talk first….”


"That's right."


"I will apologize."


Did I hear that wrong? Grace narrowed her eyes.


"I didn't mean to underestimate you or to think I could wash away my sins with money. Since you wouldn't accept my apology, I just hoped you would at least accept the money. I just want to give you something you would be willing to accept."



"I don't like your money either."


"Yeah, you probably hate whatever I do."


The man murmured in a locked voice.



"I’m glad you took care of it."
"Isn't that the case? I wouldn't say such things to someone who's just a guest."


As Grace glared, the man sat back down in the dining chair, crossed his legs casually, and boasted.


"Ellie said she was happy that Dad was home. She also mentioned that she wanted Dad. Ultimately, it seems that she likes me as a father."

“Don’t lie.”


"Ask yourself."


The man gestured toward the bedroom. Ellie was standing in front of the bedroom door, rubbing her eyes while holding a rabbit doll, having come out at some point.

"Did our princess sleep well?"


The man reached out his hand to the child walking this way. But Ellie avoided that hand and ran to Grace.


"Mom."


The child clung to her leg and rubbed his drowsy face against his mother's palm. But Grace, as always, did not embrace him; instead, she bent down to meet Ellie at eye level.

"Mom, did you do a good job at work? Kiss."


“Ellie, stand up straight. Did you forget what I said about not following strangers?”


She spread her arms and caught the child trying to hug her, standing him up straight while sternly scolding him.


"Huh? Mom has told you so many times."


The smile that had spread across the rosy face disappeared. The child, looking bewildered, turned to the man and whispered to Grace while sucking their thumb.

"But that's Ellie’s dad."


At that moment, Grace was at a loss for words. She had never been told not to follow the person referred to as Dad. It wasn’t candy or toys, and yet she had obediently followed the word Dad. More than that, it seemed to mean that she wanted to have a dad, leaving her in a daze.



"It's my fault, so don't do that to the child."
As the child quieted down with their face buried in their shoulder, Grace turned her body to face the man and lowered her voice to question him.

"Do you know how dangerous your actions were today?"


"No, I can't agree with that."


Leon lowered his head so that he could feel Grace's body temperature and breath, whispering softly so that the child would not hear.



"There is no one in the world who kidnaps a child using the word 'dad.' Usually, children don't obediently follow when I say I'm their dad."



He placed his hand on the head of the child who was occasionally sniffling and shaking.


"This child has recognized that I am her father. It also means that she wants a father. You have no right to take away the father from the child just because you don't want me."

Grace lifted her head to the point where her nose touched the man's and quietly, yet distinctly, enunciated each word as she spat them out.



“If Dad made a child to satisfy his own desires, it’s better not to have one.”


The man, hearing the accusation that he used his child for his own selfish desires, let out a laugh as if he couldn't understand it.



“Grace, every human creates a child to satisfy their own desires. To continue the family line, because they need someone to support them in old age, simply because they like children, or even by accident while enjoying themselves. No one makes a child for the sake of the child.”


While Grace was at a loss for words, the man slid his hand, which had been stroking Ellie’s head, over to rest on her hand as she patted the child's back.

“The important thing is whether you take responsibility until the end or not. You are taking away from me the right to hold responsibility.”



Grace brushed her hand away.


"Don't try to shake me with such hollow words as responsibility. You just want this child as a means to hold onto me."



"That's not it. I actually hoped you had left the child at the townhouse that day. Then it would have been much harder to find you. Still, I would have raised the child with a truly joyful heart. Maybe it would have been a little easier to endure the time without you."

"I'm telling you, it's not an uncle, it's Dad."


"Mom, I'm not mad anymore. It's okay."


Grace's mood instantly lightened as she embraced Ellie and kissed her on the forehead. When she wiped away the long trace of tears on her cheek with her hand, the child looked up and asked.

"Mom, aren't you angry?"


"I didn't hear it. But now, you shouldn't follow strangers."


The child quickly nodded and pointed at the man sitting next to him, shouting.


“Tell that uncle to go out.”


The man, who was not only called "uncle" but also told to leave, had a face as if he had been struck. He shot a glance at Grace, a silent pressure urging her to say that he was right. Grace pretended not to notice and just picked off the lint stuck to Ellie's pajamas.



"Ellie, it's Dad."


"No, it's an uncle I don't know."


"He's a stranger, they say. Get out."


"Get out, Maja."


As Ellie continued to turn away, and with Grace adding to it, the man's expression grew increasingly worse. The more this happened, the more perplexed Grace became.

He was a man who, without a doubt, would have been rejected in the past and could not overcome the humiliation, coming out forcefully. However, this man was not trying to suppress with force now, but rather attempting to persuade with words. No, it was closer to begging than persuasion.


Is the Leon Winston I knew dead?


It was to the extent that one would wonder who had killed him to only take the outer shell. A man who had thought nothing of being hated by the king was at a loss over being hated by a mere two-year-old, going back and forth between heaven and hell over a child's reaction.



"I had fun playing with Dad today."



As the child nodded, a flush of color appeared on the man's face.
The thought that I have no discernment in judging people made my head spin. In a way, that too can be said to resemble me, so I had no words to say.

"Ellie…. "


Now Grace felt hurt and wanted to ask Ellie for a hug. But she was an adult, not a child. Because of the childish conflict between adults, the innocent child who had been caught in the middle from the beginning couldn't be dragged into it again.



Grace looked at a man with pained eyes like mine. Seeing his slumped shoulders, the image of burying my face in Eli's hood last night and shaking my shoulders came to mind.

If I had tried to forcefully take him away as that man said, it would have already been done. If Eli wants the words "dad" and love from him, it would have been enforced already. Perhaps that arrogant man would have left, saying that he doesn't need any affection from someone like you, even after this level of humiliation.


However, the man not only stayed here waiting for the child and her verdict, but has now even gone down on his knees.



"Grace, please...."


I still cannot believe or forgive that man. I still want that man to suffer. Despite the cries of reason, Grace was confusedly alternating her gaze between the man on his knees and her daughter, who was sucking her fingers and urging him, and without realizing it, she spoke out.



"That's right, Ellie’s dad."


At that moment, the same smile was etched on two remarkably similar faces. Grace swallowed a sigh and set the child down on the floor. When she gently nudged the back of the child, who was looking at her with sparkling eyes, the child hesitantly approached his still kneeling dad.


"Dad...."


The man, who was watching with tearful eyes as the child approached me with open arms, couldn't contain himself the moment he heard those words and pulled the child into a hug. Soon, the man's smile twisted.

"Our daughter."


As the suppressed voice sounded as if it were drenched, Grace closed her eyes.
