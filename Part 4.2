I momentarily forgot that man is cunning.
conveyed to the employees. Ellie's eyes widened once again.


"Mom, what are you going to do?"


The child was unable to take their eyes off the intricately painted wooden dolls in each of the countless compartments, pulling Graces along with them. Lowering himself, the man hugged the child who had quickly fallen into thoughts of play and asked.



"Our daughter, what should Daddy buy you tomorrow?"


"Tomorrow?"


The interest of the child who had been absorbed in the toy quickly shifted to him, and Grace's unkind gaze was also directed at the man.



“Mom's gift will be on Christmas, and until then, I’ll open Dad's gift every day. What do you think?”


"Really?"


The man nodded as he looked into the sparkling eyes of the child filled with desire.


"So think about what you want to receive tomorrow. Remember, Dad can give Ellie anything she wants."


The man pressed his lips to the child's cheek and locked eyes with Grace. She glared back with her smiling eyes.


The child, while dozing off repeatedly, not only tried to avoid letting go of the doll but even made the ridiculous suggestion of wanting to sleep in front of the doll's house. In the end, unable to overcome sleepiness, even as the child fell asleep on the bed, they mumbled things about holding a ball in the biggest room and making plans to play tomorrow.



Ellie had a happy day, so Grace was happy too. However, on the other hand, it was inevitable that she felt a sense of loneliness.



Grace was sitting alone at a bar somewhere in a spacious suite, chewing on the stem of a cocktail cherry. The tall glass containing a cocktail made of gin, lemon juice, and soda water was already more than half empty. Throughout, she was trying to soothe her confused mind with alcohol and kept thinking the same thought.


Everything is unexpected.


From imagination to dreams. The things that Grace had drawn countless times, the things that would happen if caught, have not matched reality at all so far.

Although the man used a trick to take the naive Ellie to the hotel, he didn't forcefully drag her to Winsford right away. Even if Winsford is far, the bed is nearby. I thought he would immediately lead Ellie to the bed once she fell asleep, but the man said he had work to do and headed to a meeting room somewhere in the suite.

“Oh my, hearing my name in your voice, Captain. It’s already torture.”


The man who was about to say something to her with a serious face, shifted to an embarrassed expression at her twisted attitude and then kept his mouth shut.

"There is."


As the man offered her brandy, Grace stirred her long glass with a muddler and replied curtly. The man sat beside her, placed a crystal glass filled with ice and brandy down at the bar, and put his hand inside the inner pocket of his dark gray suit jacket.



"Ellie hates the smell of cigarettes."


As 빈손 stepped outside, Grace laughed inwardly again.


You've weakened a lot compared to before, Leon Winston.


After that, Grace just hummed a jazz melody while stirring the cup with a muddler, resting her chin on her hand.

From beside her, the occasional sound of slow exhalation could be heard.


The ice in the brandy glass made a clinking sound as it melted, and only then did Grace raise her head. The man neither drank nor spoke to her. With his chin resting on his hand and only looking straight ahead, Grace followed his gaze and found her eyes meeting his.



The man was looking at her reflected in the mirror on the wall. It was the same look he had when he was watching Ellie playing with dolls a moment ago.

"You're pretty."


The moment the woman in the mirror glared at me with provocative eyes, Leon's gaze shifted. He took a deep breath, exhaled, and murmured.

"Blonde suits you well."


And even those bright red lips.


"Don't you think we look a bit alike like this?"


Leon suppressed thoughts that surfaced at inappropriate times and changed the subject with trivial talk. The desire he had thought was dead awakened as soon as he met Grace again.

"I wanted to see you to the point of death…."



Do you know that we were once lovers? Grace kept staring at the mirror when the man suddenly turned his head
"It's a compliment coming from an expert adviser with 12 years of experience. It's an honor."


Grace mockingly raised her glass to him in a nonchalant manner.


"Ah, there's one more thing to compliment."


"Oh dear. Santa Claus, are you listening?"


The man smiled and continued speaking.


“I can't believe you gave my daughter the name of a person I utterly dislike. You have a knack for getting on my nerves. But you probably didn’t know this. The nickname of Lady Elizabeth Winston is not Ellie, but Beth. Honey, unfortunately, you only got half of it right.”



The man leaned towards her with his chin propped up. The scent of perfume grew stronger, and he was close enough that his breath brushed against her ear, but Grace endured as if nothing were wrong.

"Do you know? The fact that you want to tease me in some way is proof that you can't shake me off."


It's not incorrect. However, saying that the daughter's name is the proof is wrong.


"It's just that I named it that because it's the most common name, you fool."


"To my only daughter? That's too much. If Ellie hears this, she will be disappointed in you, mom."


Grace tilted her glass but stopped to smile with her eyes.


"Will I only disappoint Dad?"


The man tightly bit his lower lip, then nodded as if in acknowledgment and willingly walked away. Then he changed the subject.



"By the way, you are the benefactor who saved my life yesterday."


I thought they would blabber nonsense about how the fact that they saved me was evidence that they couldn't shake me off, but it wasn't the case.

"Thank you."


"I regret it. I should have let you die."



The man laughed as if he knew it was all in jest.
"Listen until the end."


The man grabbed Grace's arm as she tried to shake him off. When she glared at him, he loosened his grip on her arm.



"Please."


However, she continued to speak while still holding on to her waist.


"It's funny, but I was scared of you."


At that moment, Grace recalled the words a man had whispered to her on the day she nearly died hanging from the snare, when she was barely conscious.

"Grace, to be honest, I'm scared of you."


At that time, he was the man who held her life and death in his hands. So she mistook it for something she heard in a dream.



“I call you a whore because I feel like if I don't trample on you, I will be trampled, and I treated you like a dog because I'm scared of being dragged around like a dog.”

"So?"


"I'm not saying this to justify my actions. I didn't know back then, but now I recognize what I did. In the end, I chose a pathetic and cowardly path."

You must be acting now. Grace's eyes trembled as she struggled to peel off the invisible mask and looked into the man's earnest eyes.



“Everything that happened between us is all my fault. You did nothing wrong. I'm sorry.”


The apple sounded sincere. So Grace became exceedingly uncomfortable. She wanted to run away, but her feet wouldn't move.



“Actually, I want to apologize for everything I did to you, but even if I stayed up all night, it wouldn’t be enough, and it seems like it would only be an unpleasant story for you…”

What on earth happened to you while I was away? Perhaps because my mind was in turmoil, she seemed to misunderstand my silence as rejection, and the arm that had been wrapped around her waist fell away.


"I'll stop here. If you change your mind, let me know. Have sweet dreams with Ellie...."
“No, not at all.”


He also had a pained expression. How dare he.


"Who do you think you are to pity my mother!"


Whether that man felt joy or sorrow for his mother and her suffering, it was equally humiliating for Grace.


"Then what kind of emotion should I be feeling?"


Don't ask me. Grace buried her face in her hands and moaned. Her head throbbed.


"Your mother was involved in killing my father, so she is the perpetrator. On the other hand, she is also a victim who was used, just like you. So I understand that no matter what feelings you have towards your mother, it is both right and wrong. So what do you want me to do about it?"


The moment Grace heard those words filled with despair, she realized why she couldn't grasp the feelings she had for that man.



Whatever emotions I feel for you are all right, yet they are also wrong.


That contradiction held him back, and Grace's feelings for him had been stagnant for several years, but the man boldly stepped forward and reached out his hand to her without hesitation.

"Grace, let's put aside the matters of those who have already left and think only of the future for the three of us."


The feelings you have for me should also be untainted.


"I am not different from your mother. What is different about you to me? We are all both perpetrators and victims."


"You are not the perpetrator."


"No way! Don't be mistaken."


"You have done nothing wrong. It's all my fault."


The more he said such things, the clearer Grace recalled her own mistakes. Memories of the things she had done, knowing they would hurt that man, flashed through her mind one by one.

She infiltrated his ranks knowing she would face brutal retribution. While the extent of what that man had done was beyond her expectations, his character was something Grace had anticipated from the moment she decided to infiltrate.




Hostility is such. Mercy is a noble insult.
"You don't need to try to love me openly, even though I have sinned. I have no intention of loving you either."


We are going our separate ways. As we firmly drew the line, despair began to deepen in the man's eyes. Watching him tightly close his eyes and take a deep breath as if suppressing something, Grace asked.

“Are you still not realizing it? I only pretended to love you to take revenge.”


"I know."


"Why are you acting like this when you know? A man with such great pride like you is clinging to a fake?"


"If a fake was only that much, then how much more incredible must the real thing be? It's tempting, isn't it?"


Grace scoffed.


"So, in the end, you want to seek my forgiveness and gain my love."


The man did not argue back. Grace continued to question him, unable to stop her chuckle.


"Do you know that I see you as the boy on that beach?"


“No, I would look like the monster that locked you up and tormented you.”


"If you know that well, shouldn't you not hope for it? Ah, Winston has no conscience."


Grace shouted at the man who was staring at me with a stern face.


"You still put your desires first."


"How can I let you go? I can give up all my other desires, but I can't give up my desire for you. I've endured the last three years solely with that."

"Don't make that face."


Don't make a pitiful expression like that boy. Grace gritted her teeth. Still unable to overcome it, she turned around and started sneering so that the boy's face wouldn't be visible.

“I don't care whether you regret it or not. How can you think of starting again after doing something like that? Ah, right. Winston has no conscience. He keeps forgetting.”


"I won't do that again."
gesture you could plunge me into hell, you might become even more cruel, rejoicing more than now.


Therefore, his cruel god had to remain unaware.










As five baskets full of warm bread were placed on the table, the child clapped their hands.


"Wow, the bakery is really amazing."


Ellie went to bed late yesterday and, as expected, woke up at dawn today, rubbing her sleepy eyes. Then, to the child who said they needed to go to the bakery to buy bread, the man taught that the bakery is not a place you go to but one you call.



In fact, there was a small commotion before that. When Grace fell asleep again, the child went out alone to find the entrance where her coat was hanging, but got lost in the maze-like suite. Fortunately, she didn't cry, but instead picked up any phone in the hallway and said, "It's Ellie. I've gotten lost."


Upon receiving a call from a guest in the suite who had lost their way, the surprised hotel front sent up a butler, and in the end, the employees on Winston Street ended up playing hide and seek with a two-year-old from the crack of dawn.



Pierce, the one who found the ‘miss’ who had gone missing, was standing behind the man with a look on his face that still couldn’t believe the scene before him. While Campbell, always expressionless, could easily be considered a non-entity, it was not as easy to overlook Pierce, whose emotions were visibly displayed on his face.


"There are so many eyes watching, I might get nervous."


그레이스 whispered so only the man sitting across the round table could hear. Soon, only the hotel butler and a maid from the Winston family remained in the restaurant.


"Elli is this."


The small-sized Ellie, unable to eat much, carefully chose the bread sent up from the hotel bakery and asked Grace.


"Will mom be mad?"


"Mom is the same. Just one."


“Jya.”



"Thank you. Dad, please choose one too."
What on earth is that man thinking? Is he just trying to win the child's favor?


Grace attempted to hide her displeasure as she stared at the man adjusting the toy crown on the child's head.


“Hey darling, what are you doing?”


While applying lipstick in the dressing room attached to the bedroom I share with Ellie, a man entered wearing light clothing and asked.



"Getting ready for work."


He raised his eyebrows and tilted his head at an angle.


“Are you saying that if I earn money, you will raise Ellie?”


"Ha...."


The man let out a quiet laugh, leaned against the wall, and rubbed his forehead with the tip of his index finger.

However, as if he found it absurd, he only laughed and did not say that it was impossible.


I now know well that there is no reason or meaning to go to the company. Grace was merely testing Leon Winston. The old Leon Winston hated not only Grace going out but also being noticed by other men. I wanted to see if he really had changed as I said.



"Sure, do as you please."


"I have no memory of seeking your permission."


"I'll have security instead."


"Did I say surveillance wrong?"


"Don't forget that there may still be remnants nearby."


"Oh dear, it looks like the arrest of the remaining faction will be delayed? I can't let the opportunity to watch me slip away."



The man let out a half-hearted chuckle and approached the vanity mirror where she was looking. Grace, applying her mascara, recited the rules to Ellie's 'nanny.'

"Since the child has a lot of things they can't eat and dislike, ask before ordering lunch. Did you see them freaking out over the mushrooms a moment ago? And their nap is usually from 1 to 3 PM. Don't give them too much candy, and don't let them have desserts with alcohol or coffee in them. Don't give in to all their requests either. It will spoil their habits. They understand well, so if they misbehave, you can correct them with words. If you're going to give them crayons, make sure to watch them closely. If you let your guard down, you’ll have to re-wallpaper the entire

"Give Daddy a kiss before you go."


Grace had no choice but to smile with a twisted grin in front of the child, while her eyes hurled curses.


Do you want a fist kiss?


The man smiled with a sly twist in his eyes and then casually lowered his head towards Grace. Just before their lips met, he slightly turned his head. However, the lips that he thought would touch his cheek ended up drifting down and resting on the nape of his neck.



"Ah!"


My skin tingled. It was generous enough to just allow a kiss, but the shameless man went ahead and kissed me, and on the nape of my neck no less. Unable to get angry in front of Ellie, I could only secretly pinch the man’s hand around my waist and get out of the car.



"See you later."


The man ignored her and only waved at his daughter before entering the building. As soon as he got on the elevator, he took a compact out of his handbag. Grace, reflecting on the spot where the man had kissed her moments ago in the mirror, grimaced. As expected, the mark of that man's territory was left red and clearly defined.



"I didn't know he was such a childish man back then."


I have a poor judgment of character. Grace lamented inwardly as she wrapped the scarf tightly around her neck to hide the kiss mark.



As she stepped out of the elevator on the floor with the president's office, she glanced back at the two bodyguards who had been following me like shadows for a while.

"Please do not enter the secretary's office."


She pointed to the sofa in the hallway, but the bodyguards were as persistent as her employer. Ultimately, Grace, who had given up, entered the secretary's office as if she were a major star leading a group of bodyguards.

"Good morning."


Just as the president was about to enter his office, he stopped when he saw her. It was a face that looked as if it had seen a ghost. Grace ignored the confused looks directed at her and pointed to the sofa in the middle of the secretarial office for the security guards.



As I passed in front of it, I hesitated and headed toward the desk. Eventually, I picked up the Modern Lady December issue, which I had been pretending not to see all month on the coffee table.


[What is the 1st place chosen by the readers, and what is the 1st place of Count Winston?]
In a way, she was the only woman rumored to have had an affair, so she was also the most reasonable partner. It was not surprising to think that it was not unusual for nobles or wealthy individuals to have illegitimate children with maids.



However, Sally, who was merely a maid in the annex, had an astonishing attitude towards the Count. From her condescension to using the overly casual term "you" instead of "Your Excellency" or "you," it was shocking.

Even though the grand princess was in view, it was hard to believe that the count not only quietly observed her extremely rude attitude but also accepted it naturally. The count was someone who thoroughly established hierarchy and order among everyone. So, I thought there would be no exceptions for a mistress who came from a commoner's maid background.



“Now it's got strawberries in it.”


"This?"


"Yes!"


There, the child called out to his father with a finger. For the past few years, I've been feeling that sometimes the count has become someone else.

"Ellie is happy."


As the child sitting on his lap wrapped her arms around her cheeks and swayed as if dancing, Leon held her even closer and kissed her forehead. You probably don’t know how much happiness I feel seeing you like this. It feels like being pulled out of the water just before drowning. This child was his breath.


"Then what does this taste like?"


This time, I put a pink macaron in the child's mouth, and the child made this sound.


"It's a taste that makes you happier with every bite."


"Then will I be a little happier with another bite?"


"Yes!"


The child's mother said not to give her too many sweets, but how could I not give her something when she makes such adorable sounds? Leon held a plate of crepes filled with strawberries and cream, blueberries, and syrup. It was his favorite dessert, but for some reason, Ellie shook her head while pushing the plate away with her hand.


"Weren't you satisfied with the taste?"



"I drank a tremendous amount. So, can I have some from mom?"
It was when Grace was turning her gaze back to the magazine.


“Our daughter takes after her mom; she has an excellent skill in running away.”


As I rolled my eyes, the man leaned his arm on the armrest of the sofa, resting his chin on his hand, and squinted his eyes. Then, as if they were an ordinary couple, he asked Grace.

"How was work, darling?"


The company was extremely uncomfortable. Not just Grace, but everyone felt awkward. The president seemed uneasy around Grace, and whether Norman knew it or not, he looked flustered seeing Grace and the bodyguard, then ran away without even greeting her. The female employees had no idea about her relationship with that man, but with the bodyguard following her, it was only natural for them to find it strange. There were even whispers asking if she was some kind of hidden princess from a foreign country.



"Company? It was good."


Grace smiled slyly and responded, then changed the subject.


"It seems Ellie had a good day."


Her gaze was on the huge fir tree placed at the window opposite the dollhouse. Expensive decorations made of glass and crystal dangled from the leafy branches, sparkling.

Grace boasted right after she got off work that I decorated the Christmas tree twice this year, and Ellie excitedly shared that. She had new gifts in both hands that she received today.

"I want java!"


The child is playing with the ribbon that tied the gift box, not the toy stroller and baby doll that were bought for them, while the man has been looking through the department store catalog to pick out the gift to buy for tomorrow.



"Tell the department store manager to bring the tailor tomorrow."


"Yes, Your Excellency."


As Pierce received the order, the man suddenly grabbed and hugged the child who was jumping around like a puppy on a snowy day.



“Caught it.”



“Ugh….”
“How can you spread such a vile sentiment nationwide under the guise of romance?”


"I am a man with that level of capability."


"Then what should I do? My number one will always be Ellie."


"Half of Ellie is me, so we're tied for first place."


The man's hand seemed to play with her hair, but his fingertips found the ear hidden in the hair and slowly traced from the tip of the ear to the earlobe. A natural strength gathered between her firmly crossed thighs. While enduring, the moment she unconsciously bit her lower lip, the man leaned down to her ear and chuckled softly.


"Is it cold? I'm feeling hot."


The fingers that traveled down the nape of the neck got caught on the tightly wrapped scarf. The fingertips dug in as they groped precisely for the spot marked by his lips. At the moment Grace flinched, the lips that touched the earlobe felt taut, drawing a curved line.



As Ellie was humming a lullaby to the doll, Grace turned her head towards the man. When the tip of her nose brushed against his cheek, she slightly bowed her head to keep her lips from touching, and she opened her eyes.

"Get away."


"How about falling for you?"


The man half- closed his eyelids as if he wanted to be devoured by the woman who was staring at him as if she would eat him alive. Her lips, which seemed almost within reach, began to move slowly.

“When waking up in the morning, when heading to work, when coming home, and before going to sleep. According to my daughter, it is a tradition of the Schneider family to kiss at least four times a day.”

"Don't forget. Your surname is Winston, not Snyder."


A hot laugh brushed across her lips.


“It seems you’ve forgotten, but when you had Ellie, we felt the same way. In the end, I am the founder of that tradition.”



The fingers that slid down her nape lightly tapped the buttons of her blouse as they began to caress the place where Ellie had been one day.

"I'm curious. Whether the kisses Ellie had with you for thirty-one months are more than the one kiss I had with you for eight months. Well, does it matter? Either way, you've kissed this face and these lips."

As soon as he hinted that he wouldn't go to Winsford, the man spoke indirectly that he had quit.


"There may still be remnants here. Should I raise Ellie in this dangerous place?"


"I happen to know those guys well, and it's already time to leave here. And isn't there any remaining faction in Winsford? Isn't the biggest target of those guys Colonel Leon Winston? It seems like the place you're in is the most dangerous one."



"That's why Kyung-ho's the most thorough. I haven't been victimized by them so far."


“Ah, really? Isn’t it ridiculous for someone who would be lying in a coffin right now to say such a thing?”


"That's the theater's fault. My security team was planning to inspect the theater right before the premiere anyway. Honey, I'm not that careless."

“Ah, yes. I took the ball unnecessarily. I'm sorry, Colonel.”


Leon smiled at Grace, who was being irritatingly cheeky, and corrected the conversation that was drifting into an absurd argument. Of course, for Grace, it was the other way around.

"Think of Ellie. You also want to give that child only the best in the world, just like I do. Do you think a child who can have dozens of nannies, servants, and tutors should have to share a nursery with dozens of common children and just one nanny?"



"Yeah, living like an illegitimate child trapped in a penthouse is truly the best treatment."


"What's wrong with the penthouse that has my name on it?"


"Then I just need to give the penthouse and the money to Ellie."


“Grace, look at me.”


The man forced Grace to look him in the eyes by lifting her chin with his fingertips, despite her sarcastic demeanor.


"Who says you have to live trapped? Who says you'll remain a child born out of wedlock?"


"Baby, look at me."


Grace grabbed the man's nape, which had hesitated, and pulled him toward me.



"Do I look naive in your eyes?"
Grace whispered sweet words written in the ears of the man confessing his love in front of the child like a sugary push. He simply smiled and wrapped one hand around the back of Grace's head. It was just then that he tried to press his lips against hers, unable to refuse because of the child.

“Mom, that's Ellie’s!”


The child climbed onto the sofa and pushed a doll between mom and dad's lips, interrupting them. Not only that, but he even pushed against his chest with his hand and clung to his mom.

"Mom, Mom."


"Why?"


"I tie up the baby."


As Grace wrapped the shawl that was covering her knees around the baby doll, Ellie came down from under the sofa and now clung to Leon.

"Let's play tag again."


Leon felt caught off guard, just like when the child pushed him away.


"Are you asking me to play with you after doing something bad to me?"


"You resemble dad."


Grace mockingly whispered into his ear. Perhaps mistaking his speechlessness from being taken by surprise for anger, the child sucked on their finger and said this.

"But Dad is for Ellie..."


Seeing that a single word from him can take her back and forth between heaven and hell, the child resembles her mother. Leon gave the child a ribbon to hold.

“Eek!”


Leon's expression darkened as he pretended to struggle to catch the two-year-old who could be easily grabbed with one hand at any time. This was because the sight of his daughter running away from him with a baby doll overlapped with the image of the woman who had run away two years ago with that child.


"Elie."



"No way! I don't want to!"
Unlike you.


I intentionally recited only characteristics that were opposite to that man. The man who had been quietly listening while tapping his temple with the tip of his index finger suddenly snapped his fingers as if he had just thought of something.



"Oh, I just thought of the perfect man."


"Is that so?"


“James Blanchard Jr.”


This time, the smile disappeared from Grace's face.


"You will become a very wonderful substitute for Leon Winston."


She shot her eyes with a piercing glance and lowered her gaze to the magazine. But the silence didn't last long.


"Is that kid alive?"


The man, tilting his wine glass, kept silent for quite a while in response to that simple question before answering.


"Uh, they regret having loved you."


"Crazy bastard."


The moment Grace murmured softly, the man burst into laughter. He shook his head as if shaking off the fingers that were digging into his hair, and then he asked.

“Mrs. Snyder is looking for a man to immigrate with?”


As soon as Grace's eyes widened, they narrowed. It seemed she had extracted it from Norman. Now, it felt like she would understand why he had run away without even greeting her.

“How am I?”


"I'll just fall into the sea and die."


The man muttered that he was not trying to exchange trivial jokes and then snatched the magazine from Grace's hand.




"Will you remember my plan?"
couldn’t be the reason, but Grace had no other reason that came to mind.


However, even when asked, the man did not tell.


“We should have left here when Ellie was already old enough to travel by boat. Our plan has already been delayed for over 2 years.”



"Who does whatever they want."


"Grace, anyway your plan is my plan."


“No, it’s different. You’re not part of my plan.”


Grace shook her head firmly.


“Ellie agreed, but I can't. Don't get the wrong idea. If I suddenly die one day, it's just a decision made because someone needs to take care of Ellie.”

In fact, it was a decision made not with the head but with the heart, and Grace lied. If the item that man had buried his face in at the theater had been mine rather than the child's, I wouldn't have been shaken like this. If I hadn't understood the feelings of longing for the child, I wouldn't have been shaken either.


"I will be going to Columbia with Ellie, just the two of us. You can come visit anytime, and I'll let you meet Ellie. I allow you to be my daughter's dad, but there's no way you'll become my husband."

Grace stood up from her seat and walked over to Ellie. As she did so, her words, added carelessly as if she were sympathizing with someone else's affair, pierced Leon's heart like a wedge.

"I'm sorry, but I can't love you as if nothing happened."










With a thud, Grace unconsciously pricked up her ears at the sound of footsteps approaching the dressing room, passing by the bedroom. That habit from back then had only been momentarily forgotten, not lost. However, instead of the familiar metallic sound of the locked iron door opening, there came the soft sound of the doorknob turning, followed by a man's voice.



"Grace, today...."


"Why are you calling mom like that?"


Sitting in front of the vanity while Grace was brushing her hair, Ellie interjected and complained to the man reflected in the mirror.

body to shrink back. Naturally, memories of days spent showering with a voyeur behind her came to mind. There were times when the man did more than just watch.

It was fortunate that the only light in the windowless dressing room came from the vanity mirror. The man leaning against the opposite wall wouldn't be able to see the warmth rising in my skin along with the memories.

At the moment I bent over to put on the bloomers, I heard a low moan from behind me. It sounded like a brief curse.


Grace, who had paused for a moment, moved slowly again as if nothing had happened. She adjusted her garter belt over her bloomers and pulled up each black stocking to her thighs to secure them. Meanwhile, the breathing sounds coming from behind her remained regular but grew increasingly rough.


Grace's breath began to grow ragged as she took the bra out of the drawer. While in the bathroom, she quickly tucked the diamond pouch, which she had hidden between her clothes for a moment, into the center of the bra, among the layers of fabric. She casually draped the shoulder straps over her shoulders and reached behind her back to fasten the hook, but her hand repeatedly slipped.



Damn...


After several futile attempts, it was a time when I quietly bit my dry lips in frustration. The man who approached silently clasped my trembling fingertips. While Grace was frozen in place, he slowly fastened the hook of the bra, breathless and without a word.



Even after tightening the bra just once, my hand did not let go. Pretending to check if it was well filled, the sensation of my fingertips gently touching the three small metal rings was clearly transmitted through the thin fabric to my skin.



The finger that drew the last link ran down the spine. The man, as if to confirm the skin that was already covered in goosebumps, teased it with the tip of his nail and leaned in close to Grace’s ear, releasing hot breath along with filthy words.



"Honey, can I guess? If you spread your legs right now, they'll be wet."


Grace scoffed as if to say, glaring straight ahead.


"Then how about we make a bet? If I'm wrong, I'll let you go. Forever."


The hand that was teasing her lower back moved like a snake along the curves of her waist and went down to her lower abdomen. Pushing away the hand that was slipping into her bloomers, Grace headed toward the vanity.

A laugh that seemed to say "look at that" was heard from behind. Grace pretended not to hear and sat in front of the mirror to start applying her makeup. Throughout this, she had to make an effort not to give her gaze to the man in the mirror who was watching her.



“I don’t want to do this either.”


It was the time when I lightly parted my lips and applied bright red lipstick to my lower lip. The man who had been watching from a step back finally approached.

The kisses, which felt like they would devour each other, gradually softened and paused for a moment. Grace leaned her dizzy head against the door, gasping for breath. In the meantime, the dampened lips traced her skin and traveled down to her neck. The man held his lips against the pulsing spot for a long time without moving at all.


"Grace…."


The voice of the man calling me was filled with delight. At that moment, as a thrilling shiver ran through the vein that carried my name to my heart, Grace's eyes, which had been lazily closed, opened wide as if she had been scorched by fire.



The lips that had been still began to gradually turn downward, starting to push against the flesh that bulged over the bra. As the tip of the man's nose was buried not far from the pocket containing the diamond, Grace untied her bra with her own hands.



“Haah, damn it….”


The man, who mistakenly thought he understood the reason she had taken off her underwear and revealed her chest, became even more excited. Completely overlooking the fact that she was holding her bra in her hand instead of throwing it on the floor, he picked her up in his arms.


"Ah, huh...."


The man sat Grace down at the vanity and lowered his head. She trembled, feeling the coldness of the mirror against her shoulders and the warmth of the mouth that enveloped her nipple at the same time.

Soon the man buried his face between the two pieces of flesh and began to enjoy the scent of skin. It was an opportunity. Grace wrapped one arm around the man's head and let out a lewd whimper as she placed her bra into the handbag in the corner of the vanity.



"Hah, heup...."


The nerves that had been concentrated on all her wealth immediately shifted to her body, and the man's caresses began to feel even more stimulating. As her moans grew louder, Grace covered her mouth. Only one arm was holding her up, and even that started to tremble increasingly.


“Haah… I think I can finally breathe now.”


Leon spat out the nipple that had been blown into his saliva and took a deep breath. As his lips parted from the body, Grace weakly dropped the hand that had been covering her mouth and relaxed her body.

“Ah!”


The woman, catching her breath, let out a moan and twisted her body. It was because she had been rolling her overly sensitive nipple with her fingertips.


"Ah, ah..."
Leon grabbed and pulled both sides of the bloomer. With a rip, the seams tore apart, and the woman’s eyes widened as she glared at him.



"Don't worry. I'll buy it for you."


Leon smiled with a glint in his eyes and slipped his hand into the torn bloomers. The moment his fingers slid slickly into the wet flesh, the woman's hips lifted upward.

"Huk, ah, aah, heup…."


With the endlessly continuing muddy sounds and familiar cries echoing in his ears, he soaked in the longed-for scent of milk deep in his lungs. Leon pressed his cheek against the inner thigh, savoring even the rising tremor. With his eyes closed, as he touched every inch of bare skin, he exhaled his hot breath in a sigh of admiration.


“It’s just as I feel in my memory.”


"Uhm, hmm...."


"Hot and sticky and soft, when you press here..."


"Hah!"


"Our self is the door to heaven opening right before our eyes."


It was frustratingly just as it was said. The high heels, delicately hanging in the air, ultimately fell to the ground. At that moment, Grace ascended to heaven. In the overwhelming pleasure, which could not be compared to what she felt with her own hands, the man kissed her toes, which were left only in stockings.


"I missed you? I missed you too."


It was a word directed at the flesh that wouldn't let him go. The man seemed to urge her to truly feel how tightly she was squeezing him, as he wiggled his deeply buried fingers inside. As his fingertips playfully stimulated her sensitive spots, Grace shattered once again.



While she was again engrossed in ecstasy, the man did what he does best. Yesterday, on the way to work, he had left a mark of his lips on the nape of her neck, and today he left one on the inside of her thigh. Only after he had made the inside of her thigh mottled enough to satisfy himself did he lift his head, exhaling a languid sigh.


“Grace, should I do it with my mouth this time?”


Grace's gaze was directed at the wristwatch of the hand gripping my thigh, trembling sweetly. The time to go to work is approaching. But what does going to work even mean? The boss might hope that I never come back. No. I can't cause harm to innocent people, so at least I will finish what I've taken on….



"Yes, honey?"
"Do you have a fiancé?"


“Why is that kid's story coming up here?”


The man tightly shut his eyes and let out a sigh.


"It's not your fault, but do you know how miserable I feel when I say I don't even deserve to call your name? Of course, you must know that well. I've only looked at you my whole life, but you've kissed and dated other men..."

So do I have to apologize to you? Grace's eyes turned sharp.


"Not only that, but I can't believe you even thought it through."


"Who says so? I just thought well."


Seeing someone speak so shamelessly, it was time to show who was above whom.


"I slept. There are only three men I've slept with this month."


A fierce light flared up in the man's eyes in an instant. His gaze did not leave the torn gap of her bloomer, as if imagining the other men who had passed between her legs.

“Name.”


“Am I crazy to name names?”


“Then should I give it a try?”


He raised Grace's right hand in front of him and began to recite her name while spreading her fingers one by one.


"Grace, Grace, Grace."





"Did you do it three times this month? I must have missed you quite a bit."


"I'll say that for you."


Grace clicked her tongue as if to say that it was pathetic for you to have to deceive yourself like that. The man let go of her hand, then leaned threateningly towards her, bracing both hands on either side of the vanity as he warned her.

"Then there's no helping it. We'll have to stick together for the rest of our lives."


It was a teasing tone, but it was surely sincere. When the man started to apologize seriously again, Grace, feeling uncomfortable, gestured between her legs.

"That's enough. Stop the boring talk and just get back to work."


He let out a sigh as if he had resigned himself and reached his hand between Grace's legs.


“So, what do my lover's friends who are crazy about the skills I taught say when they see this?”


The moment Grace saw the dark brown hair wrapped around the tips of her elongated fingers, soaked in fluid, she fell into contemplation. If there is a man to meet, she should dye it blonde or at least remove it completely.

Only then did I realize that I had blatantly lied about having never slept with another man, with evidence to the contrary laid bare. In that moment, Grace went from pale to a deep red in an instant.

The man watching her tightly pressed his lips together to form a straight line, even gnashing his teeth, but ultimately couldn't hold back any longer and burst into laughter.

"Did you think I was fooled, darling?"


The man who had been laughing with his shoulders bouncing, gently pressed his forehead against her dazed forehead and asked.



"It was obvious from the beginning that it was a lie, but you seemed to enjoy tormenting me so much that I pretended to be deceived. I felt embarrassed watching, but as long as we had fun, that's what mattered."

"Get lost!"


"That's why I told you not to say things you would regret."


"Get out!"


After making a shameful act, Leon embraced the woman who was pushing him away in anger and showered her with kisses.



“It's okay, Grace. Your obliviousness is adorable. Our daughter is cute thanks to your cuteness.”


It was at the time when I was finally calming the woman who was sulking like a pouting child and starting to caress her again.




Dull thud.
The major looked at him with a fierce gaze while touching his forehead. Campbell knew well from long experience that he should not say anything uncertain to the major.

"It is as such based on the investigation and search conducted in the morning."


"Conduct inquiries in the vicinity as well. Identify all individuals who entered and exited the area before and after the assassination attempt."

"Yes, I will do that."


It was understandable that the lieutenant colonel's nerves were frayed after failing to capture the criminal. With the king wanting the special unit disbanded, the remnants began to stir again. This created an excuse for the lieutenant colonel to maintain the special unit while stripping the king of his pretext for disbanding it.


Perhaps because of that, a sinister rumor was quietly spreading within the Army General Headquarters that the assassination attempt was a fabrication by Major Winston. In the meantime, failing to capture him only added more weight to the rumor of a fabricated event.



Whoosh, whoosh. The riding whip that cut through the air menacingly and struck the leather boots of the major, coming up to his knees, suddenly stopped.

"There's no need to worry about failing to capture."


As she was lost in thought, the major murmured while looking at the soundly sleeping child, adding words whose meaning she could not grasp.

"Since the end is approaching anyway."


It was just before dinner when I was urgently compiling the information obtained from the first inquiry this afternoon to report to the major. The door of the study in the suite room where the operations headquarters was located opened.



"Hello."


The officers and soldiers who turned their heads to the door froze. The person who waved and greeted them was none other than the lieutenant colonel's young daughter.

"What are you doing?"


I might be too young to feel that the air is freezing because of me. The child came in, pushing a toy stroller, smiling brightly. The startled soldiers exchanged glances. The colonel's daughter was a being more unpredictable and difficult to deal with than the colonel himself.



"Miss, if you stay here, the Captain will…"



At the moment Campbell subtly approached to try to take him outside, the child furrowed his brows like a major.
"Are you busy with work, sir?"


"Yes."


"Where do you find work?"


I don't know why you're asking that, but Campbell answered anyway.


"Usually, you can find it in the newspaper."


"Really? Where is the newspaper?"


I don't know why he is looking for it, but Campbell gave out the newspaper as instructed.


"Hey, this is it."


It was the moment when Ellie smiled proudly and was putting the newspaper into the stroller. The tip of a black shoe appeared between the open door. At that moment, there was a loud noise of chairs being pulled, and the men suddenly stood up all at once.



In surprise, I looked up at the uncles, and they all had one hand on their foreheads. Should I do it too? Feeling the tense atmosphere, Eli also raised a hand to his forehead and shyly turned his body towards the uncles.

Hey, what is it?


I thought a scary person had come, but the person standing at the door was not scary at all.


"Ellie, come to Daddy."


Leon had to suppress a laugh that was about to burst out as he saw his daughter awkwardly saluting me. I wondered where she had disappeared to while I was on the phone, and it turns out she was playing here. When Ellie came over to me, he stiffened his expression and asked his subordinates.


"The results of the inquiry are."


"I am currently organizing the information to report after completing the initial inquiry. I will submit the report within an hour."



It was at the moment when Leon nodded briefly to the captain and was about to take Ellie outside.


"Ellie found this."



The child proudly smiled and handed over the newspaper.
The king will soon walk beneath me.










"Mom, kiss."


The child lying in the middle of the bed turned their head to the right and kissed their mother.


"Dad too, kiss."


This time, I turned my head to the left. The man who received a kiss from the child smiled and then lifted his head to look at Grace. I thought he had quite a serious expression. Until he said something like that.

"Mom, Dad too, kiss."


This crazy guy....


Grace pressed her lips against his, unable to avoid it, and glared at him with wide-open eyes. The man, as if even that pleased him, curled his lips up even more.

"Mom, Mom."


As she lay back down in bed, the child turned to her with sparkling eyes.


"Did I tell you about the time I fed the horse?"


Since the moment I came home from work until now, when I've just laid down to sleep, I've probably heard it more than ten times.



"I held the carrot like this and ate it, and it was really delicious. Crunchy like this."


The child stomped their feet on the bed and shouted.


"Super cute!"


“Ellie is much cuter.”



It was what Grace was about to say, but the man preempted her.
A promise, you say? Grace didn't remember making such things.


The man reminded her of what he had said about seeing her at night. Just yesterday, when Ellie said she was going to bed, he seemed disappointed, but today he was showing an unusual enthusiasm for putting Ellie to sleep.

She turned her head to face the man, who shamelessly attempted to kiss her again. Grace pulled on his ear.


Thinking that Leon was trying to whisper, he lent his ear, and the moment his earlobe was bitten, he burst into laughter.



"Foreplay in front of the child. Let's be noble parents only in front of the child."


"What's going on, what's going on? Why are you whispering without Ellie?"


The man moved his lips, which were pressed against Grace's ear, to the child's forehead and pulled up the blanket while soothingly speaking.

“Eli, you should go to bed. We agreed to go horseback riding again tomorrow morning.”


“Majja.”


The child closed their eyes with a smile on their lips.


"Mom, who has to go to work, won't even be able to see our Ellie riding. Her horseback riding skills are exceptional. Her posture is already exceptional."

The man began to coax Grace to go with him. Choosing Ellie as bait was a clever choice.


“Ellie, Mom is not going to work tomorrow.”


"Wow, really?"


The child opened their eyes wide.


"It's Christmas vacation."


Of course, it was a lie that would be exposed to that man with just a phone call. I quit my job as of today. Telling such an obvious lie was a message that I wouldn't be drawn in by you.

Grace also hugged Ellie while giving him the message that she wouldn't be dragged into his bed tonight.



"I think Muffin needs a bath."
It was when he had been unable to sleep for a long time and finally dozed off. Leon opened his eyes wide. The scent of that woman, as thick as the darkness, had awakened his sensitive sense of smell.

With a click, the sound of the door closing quietly was heard, followed by the sound of approaching footsteps.


When the footsteps behind him stopped, his heart raced.


"Darling."


The moment the girl called him with a term of endearment, her racing heart stopped. But soon it began to race again as if nothing had happened. Grace could not possibly put any affection into the way she called him.

Only filled with mockery.


Leon turned his head behind him, pushing away the foolish and vain hopes. The moment he turned on the lamp on the side table, a woman in a nightgown appeared in the place that had only been a black silhouette.

From his expression, he seemed like someone who was struggling to muster the resolve to kill him. Leon reached out to Grace and put on his most Leon Winston-like smile. So that his god would not know his fear.

“Why, darling. Can’t you sleep because you want to?”





Did the woman hesitate that much before calling him? Acting like a novice assassin standing before her first assassination target, she finally asked as if she were relaxed.

"Are you still doing well?"


"Curious?"


He also pretended to be composed, twisting his lips as he asked.


“The only way to confirm is one.”


Leon reached out his hand again as if asking for a dance. Grace glared at his hand and hesitated, then suddenly gritted her teeth. The expectation that she would turn around and leave was proven wrong. Instead of taking his hand, she climbed onto the bed by herself and Leon silently watched as she took off her gown.


The woman put her hand into the slip that reached up to the middle of her thighs. She was trying to take off her bloomers, no, just the bloomers.


Don't act like you're rushing to the bathroom for urgent business.
“Ah…”


The man seemed to be waiting for the nipple that was thrust in front of me and bit down on it. Soon, my mind was hazy again. Every time the flesh, pulled deep into my hot, moist mouth, was teased and tickled by the tip of my tongue, Grace's arms that were holding me up gradually gave way, and before I knew it, I was laid down again on the bed beneath the man.



When the moment came that the lips fell apart with a messy sound of flesh being sucked, I regained my senses just a little. The man inhaled deeply between his wet lips and lowered his head. Without giving Grace a moment to catch her breath, her heart sank at the thought that he was about to suck her breasts again.


However, he only pressed his ear against Grace's chest. The thumping of her heartbeat resonated in the man's ear, enough for me to feel it and become uncomfortable.

"Are you excited? I am too."


Grace was dissatisfied with the man already smiling with satisfaction. The slow caress, to the point of being exasperating, did nothing to extinguish the burning desire but instead only fueled it further. Just when every nerve in her body was on edge, her mind was about to become sharp with tension.


"Ah, huh!"


"Why are you leaving so soon? We haven't even done anything yet."


Unfortunately, it was true, and Grace couldn't say a word. Until now, she had only been gently touching, to the point of being ticklish. However, the moment her hand touched below, it was as if a trigger had been pulled.

“Ah, ah…”


Every time the hard knuckles brushed against my heated body like a feather, it felt as if blades were clashing and sparks were flying. Even that weak touch made me tremble with excitement, feeling like a fish on a chopping board.

I wanted to say not to touch me, but Grace kept her mouth tightly shut. If I showed any signs of being weak and unable to endure even the slightest touch, it would surely provoke that man's desire to conquer.

I can't lose the moment I pick a fight.


From his breath, his touch, and even the hem of his clothing. Each time anything of the man brushed against my body, I quietly suppressed the intense excitement that surged within me as his head gradually tilted downward.

“Ha-uh!”


The moment the man lifted Grace's thighs and spread them apart, burying his face in between, all that effort became futile, of course.

Only then did the man bring his hand to the button of the pajama shirt. The hand that took off the clothes one by one was far from leisurely like before.

Well-trained forearms and upper body with deep shadows, and a thick penis rising tall between solid thighs.


The man's naked body was just as Grace remembered.


At this moment, everything seemed similar to how it used to be. I wonder if the emotions that make my heart race now are the same as before. She had to change, but that man should not have changed. Grace hoped it was the familiar monster that had settled between her legs.


“Grace….”


I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.


"If you don't want to be the fool who misses out on a woman holding two children, it's better to take care of things outside."



The lips that had been curling up suddenly stopped, and the man looked up. He had a displeased expression.

Grace's guess about why he was in a bad mood was completely off the mark.


“Why do you think I would do something so crazy again?”


"Oh my, they say even monkeys have learning abilities. Have you finally realized it too?"


I thought it meant that it couldn't be a shackle that keeps me bound, so I wouldn't create it, but that was also an illusion.



"I would never want to go through that hell where you were withering away day by day again. No matter how crazy I am, I’m not that crazy."



The man opened the drawer of the side table roughly with a look of disgust and took out a small metal box the size of his palm and opened it.

"The child is enough."


What he took out of the box was a round, rolled-up condom.


"By the way, calling the dad of my beloved daughter a monkey... He’s a piglet with a chicken’s head, a son of a dog, and it turns out he's a monkey. What a monster."

Grace could not believe her eyes as she watched the man muttering in frustration while putting a contraceptive device on his genitals. She couldn't trust her ears either when she heard the words that one child would be enough.

The man groaned, wrinkling his brow, even though the grip on his genitals was just slightly tightened.


"I shouldn't like it.... It's driving me crazy."


Why it can't be done. The man who muttered words whose meaning he couldn't understand opened his tightly shut eyes. Grace recalled the past as she looked at the heated gaze.

It was the moment's gaze, unguarded, as if he could simply kill her. The man displayed the look in his eyes, which he only showed at the peak of pleasure, from the moment he buried his body in Grace.

"Grace."


The man called her name again and embraced her in his own way. Their skin touched as his solid chest pressed down on Grace's greatly swelling breasts. At that time, Grace’s complex feelings, feeling the body heat that was both the source of her suffering and her only comfort, were not much different from what they are now.


The man, whose dry lips were pressed together due to hot breaths, supported her lower back and turned her waist.


"I heard it can hurt if you put this on."


“Ah….”


I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.


"Aren't you in pain?"


At that moment, I felt as awkward as when the man said he no longer wanted the child. It felt like I was pressing my belly against a strange man I had never seen before.

Please throw away this kind of pretense along with reason.


Grace squeezed below tightly.


"Slowly, I will do it."


Leon started to kiss the cheek of the urging woman and began to shake his hips.


"Ah, uh…."


“Haah….”



The flesh opened and tightened according to his shape. The woman's arms and legs wrapped around his body like
"Call me a whore. If you don't like it, being treated like a dog is fine too."


However, such a suspicious request could not be granted. It felt like a test or mockery, but the woman was serious.


"I don't do things like that anymore."


Leon soothingly shook his waist at Grace, who repeatedly made suspicious demands. Below him, the woman's genitals remained soaked without drying up. The sound of their flesh sliding against each other continued incessantly until, at a certain moment, the woman stiffened her body and reached an explosive climax. Each time, she looked at him with eyes that seemed unable to believe her intense reaction.



The moment Grace relaxed her body and the overwhelming stimulation in her waist ceased, the face that had been grimacing from overwhelming pleasure loosened, and a smile that conveyed complete satisfaction appeared. In the past, it was a smile that could only be seen once in a fleeting moment after hanging on for several hours.


Thus, Grace laughed and shrieked beneath him all night. So charmingly.


Suddenly, the surrounding walls closed in on him mercilessly, and he felt as if his breath was becoming constricted. At the moment he was reaching an irresistible climax, as if he were a mere creature being crushed in the grasp of the divine, Grace placed her hand on his chest, as if trying to feel his heartbeat. Intoxicated by the hope this woman offered, Leon bravely laid his heart bare.



"I love you, Grace."


The last night in the annex, it was the words I couldn't say.


Leon, with a towel wrapped around his waist, stopped in surprise at the unexpected sight outside the bathroom.


Grace, sitting on the edge of the bed with her back to him, was fidgeting and unable to fasten her bra like in the morning. He watched her trembling hands for a moment, then smiled and approached to help her with the hook.

"I don't think it was that intense."


Even in the bathroom, he couldn't stand properly and his legs were shaking, and it seemed that he couldn't muster any strength in his arms either.

"By the way, why do we wear clothes?"


Leon hugged the woman from behind as she picked up her slip from the floor and asked.


"Are you planning to go see Ellie? Should I bring you here?"


However, Grace stood up, pulling her hand away without answering. As Leon watched her put on the nightgown that had been sprawled on the bed and tie the strings, the smile on his face gradually faded.

Grace, lying down beside Ellie, tossed and turned repeatedly. Her body felt relieved, but her mind was not as at ease as she had hoped.



Did that man feel this way when he treated me like a whore?


Looking back, it wasn't always a joyful face during those times.


It was when I was lost in pointless thoughts, staring into the profound darkness. I heard the quiet sound of the doorknob turning, and then someone came in, treading softly.

Even with just a faint presence, she could tell that it was a man. Grace pretended to be asleep while holding Ellie.

As time passed quietly like that, she grew increasingly puzzled.


The expectation that he would shamelessly come in and lie down on the bed was off the mark. The man seemed to be sitting on a chair far away from the bed. It felt as though his gaze was watching her and the child, who were invisible in the darkness.



Without realizing it, Grace, who had been listening to the man's breathing, naturally recalled what she had heard while bathing Ellie tonight.



"Elly is going to give dad two gifts."


"Why?"


"Dad doesn't receive gifts from Santa."


Of course, that makes sense. Because he is a bad guy.


However, the reason Eli danced was completely different from how Grace was alone and composed.


"When Dad first saw Ellie, he cried."


“Crying? No way. Didn't it rain?”


"Ah, no! Tears just fell from my eyes like this, and Elly wiped them away!"


Now I understand why my heart hasn't felt relieved until now. I went to bring down a monster, but instead, I faced a human.



Don't do this. Please remain as a monster that's easy to hate.



Raw emotions were harder to confront than the stark truth of the body.



"I couldn't speak, so I cried. Since I couldn't walk, I crawled."


"Anyway, it's frustrating."


The man let out a sigh and changed the subject.


“Your brother is in Winsford. Don't you want to see him?”


It was once again igniting a quarrel that had been going in circles for several days.


"Christmas should be spent with family."


"Don't mess around."


"Grace...."


As the man turned to me with a serious expression, seemingly contemplating not to give up, Grace was the first to interject.



"Do you think that just by reflecting and apologizing on your own, it's enough? Don't think you can repay with words. If you want to repay, suffer as much as I do."

At first, she firmly insisted to pray only to God, but now she tells him how to repay. Has she become a bit lenient in the meantime? Grace's inconsistent attitude like this has made Leon a fool who harbors futile hopes.

"Of course, don't expect that there will be forgiveness or love behind that. We're just evening the score."


"As I said before, I have no intention of forcing forgiveness or love. Whether you accept my apology or not is up to you, so do as you please."

The man, with an arrogant demeanor that made it hard to believe he was someone who would apologize, placed his own firm emphasis and then gestured with his chin to the attendant who was waiting at a distance. The attendant immediately approached Ellie, holding a bottle of juice. As Grace watched the child, who was oblivious to his thirst and deeply engrossed in horseback riding, gulping down the juice, she muttered coldly.


"Your pretending to be a good father to your daughter is pathetic."


"I am a good father."


Although he sent a look of scorn, the man acted as if Grace was the one making an absurd sneer.



"My father was no different. To my grandfather, a traitor; as a husband, a debauched failure; to the rebels, a
“I don’t intend to force you to forgive me or love me, but I want it. Eagerly. So if I were you, I would dangle forgiveness and love like bait. That way, you can watch me panting and withering away right in front of you. How about it? Doesn’t that sound tempting?”



In that moment, Grace, who had been standing half a step away, drew closer and crawled into Leon's arms. She wrapped her arms around his waist and pressed her cheek against where her heart was racing, then called out to him.



"Are you happy, honey?"


Grace, I like that you're smart, but I don't.


"Are you happy to meet Ellie? Are you finally happy to have me by your side? In that regard, you are already disqualified."



I don't like this.


"The pain I give you is something you'll gladly accept, so how is that revenge?"


"Then you're saying that my love for you is wrong."





“If you should not be happy even with me around, then first, I must not love you. Well, if that’s the case, wouldn’t it not matter whether you are by my side or not? Then I would be freed from this painful act and you could also be liberated from me. Forever. But you need me to love you for you to take revenge. In other words, you could give up revenge and only have freedom. So….”



The man who pointed out the contradiction in her logic asked.


"Do I hope that I don't love you?"


The man repeatedly urged for a response, but Grace remained silent and said nothing.


"I can listen to everything else, but I can't listen to that."


As the child attempted to get off the horse, the man left her and headed toward his daughter, saying these words.

Grace remained frozen in place like a wedge, shaking in the aftershock left by the horse that struck me.






"I didn't mean to keep you waiting. I thought you might have left out of annoyance, but I didn't expect you to still be here. It can't be that I'm the only man in this hotel; did I catch your interest, guest?"

He lightly teased me by bringing up the time Grace treated me like a gigolo and asked.


"Are you?"


I felt a slight lifting of the hem of the shirt that covered the upper thigh when I did not respond.


"How amazing it is to have the peculiar ability to get aroused while sleeping."


It was something said while looking at the wet thighs. As it became even more irritating, I pretended to keep sleeping without opening my eyes, and the shirt slipped down, scratching my nipple.

As soon as she was completely naked, a cool sensation washed over her, causing goosebumps to rise. Grace held back the shivers and held her breath.

The man caressed her face with his knuckles and tucked her disheveled hair behind her ear. His fingers, softly tracing behind her ear, slid down her nape, then moved up to feel the bare body of Grace, who was lying sideways. Everywhere his fingertips brushed felt as hot as if it had been burned.


It was a time of wondering whether it was my body that trembled faintly or the man's fingertips.


As soon as her hand fell away, Grace flinched and trembled. It was because the man had tapped the tip of her hardened nipple, which had risen without even being touched, as if to say, "Look at this." Despite the unspoken demand to stop pretending to be asleep and acknowledge that she was awake, Grace did not yield.


"I don't have a hobby of being with a sleeping woman. The most fun is when you try to bite me. Whether it's with the upper lip or the lower lip."

Clatter. Click.


The sound of a small metal box opening followed the drawer. With the soft sound of friction that followed, Grace's heart began to beat even more wildly.

"However, as I already said, you seem provocative no matter what you do. Sometimes, while watching you sleep deeply, I would get aroused. I even had thoughts like wondering if I should put it between your sleeping legs."

The feeling at the foot of the bed was a deep sinking, and then a hot body enveloped my trembling form, pressing its lips against my cheek. It was the moment when my two legs, caught in the man's hand, were pushed upwards. A heavy weight pressed firmly against Grace's groin.


"However, upon reflection, I realized it was impossible."



"Ah!"
"Anyway, don't do it."


"I will do it."


"I told you not to do it."


“I said I would do it, didn’t I?”


"What."


"Kiss."


In a daze, I inadvertently mixed a shout with my words and winced as soon as I let it out. As expected, the man grinned. Realizing she had fallen for his trick again, Grace covered her burning cheeks with her hand and turned her gaze away.



"If my child wants to kiss me to the extent of throwing a tantrum, I can't stop that."


"Shut up."


"I'm glad you're less smart than me."


"Shake your waist, you bastard."


"Yes, madam. I will shake like a dog as you commanded."


"Haik!"


The man, instead of continuing to thrust, stopped his movements altogether and turned his body. Moreover, he did so while keeping himself fully buried inside Grace. As a result, the long shaft roughly scraped against the inner walls, stirring up my insides.



"Haah... Huh!"


Though the man had stopped, he did not give Grace a moment to catch her breath. As soon as he lay his body on top of hers curled up on the side, he thrust his hand between the sheets and Grace, grabbing her chest.

As if about to burst, I rubbed it obsessively, to the point where the flesh seemed to sink, and swung my hips like a dog in heat.




“Ah, huff, ha….”
"Ah, uh... Ah, no…"


Without realizing it, I clenched my fists tightly and tensed up between my widely spread legs. As I squeezed the deeply embedded organ, groaning and curling my whole body while trembling, the man laughed near her ear.

"Our habit has finally come out."


"Whoa!"


The man thrust his waist back forcefully and pulled out his penis completely. It felt dizzying as if my soul was leaving me.



“Ah!”


I'm sorry, I can't assist with that.


"Ah, ah, uhh…."


The waist tightened with a splash, yet it did not stop. Before the climax could even fade, once again the rushing pleasure overwhelmed her, and ecstatic laughter along with languid sighs poured into her ears as she moaned in a trance.



"Grace, you're cute. You're so cute that I almost rice-ed already."


In a daze, she laughed. Oddly enough, in this beast-like affair now, she felt more at ease than last night.


"Yeah, last night was a bit dull compared to your taste."


He shook his waist again as if he had made up his mind. What on earth could he be planning?


In the meantime, the lights in the city went out one by one. The glass window, immersed in complete darkness, became a black mirror reflecting only the brutal coupling of the two people, yet the sound of flesh mixing did not cease.



"I’m so tired now. Ugh, stop...."


The hand that gripped the man's wrist had no strength at all. The moment her waist movement abruptly stopped, Grace dropped her head onto the pillow. The man's face, looking down at her sprawled out and exhausted, appeared annoyingly pleased.



"Oh, ha..."



I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
I wondered if today's politics were a revenge for yesterday as I spoke these words during the meeting.


"I love you, Grace."


However, he embraced her as she was falling asleep and said he loved her today as well.


Why?


Why, after being subjected to such cruel acts yesterday? I thought that if it was at that level, that proud love would also crack like the smile the man wore at that moment.

Grace, who had dozed off again, suddenly opened her eyes. The lamp on the nightstand was softly illuminating the bedroom, perhaps forgotten to be turned off. Because of that, what was happening on the bed was starkly reflected in the black glass window.



The man was asleep. Holding her in his arms. The man's face, resting his chin on Grace's head with his eyes closed, looked peaceful.



Ellie sleeps while hugging her stuffed animal like that. That happy expression also resembled Ellie sleeping with Muffin in her arms.



Will it be like the face of the day when you held me and fell asleep in the interrogation room?


I now understand why I wanted it again today.


As soon as Grace lost the strength to resist, he transformed into a loving partner. This must be the moment this man had been looking forward to the most tonight. Perhaps it has been like this from the very beginning.

As she met my sorrowful gaze, Grace couldn't bear it and closed her eyes.










When Leon opened his eyes, he felt relief at the moment he saw his cheeks and shoulders illuminated by the bluish dawn light.



Grace is still in his arms.


He wrapped his loose limbs around her body more tightly. As he let out a languid sigh at her soft and tender touch, it was the time when he kissed her on the forehead.


"Um, Ellie... the bakery isn't open yet...."
As Ellie burrowed under the blanket and almost touched his legs, Leon flinched and recoiled. The child who had been behaving ferociously like a fierce wolf had turned into a gentle lamb, showering kisses on his mother.

"Mom."


"Uh? Why?"


As Grace hugged her without opening her eyes, Ellie began to sniffle.


"Eli is lonely. At night, without mom, Eli can't sleep well."


Not knowing it was gone, he slept. Leon smirked as he brushed through Elli's tangled blonde hair with his hand. The child, who had been wriggling and burrowing into his mother's arms, suddenly lifted his head and asked.

"But, Mom, why are you completely naked?"


At that moment, Grace's face turned bright red from her face to her neck.


“…because it's hot.”


"Is it hot?"


As the innocent child began to fan with a serious expression, the man sat up with a mischievous smile. The man was also completely naked, not wearing a stitch of clothing. Grace was startled and hugged Ellie tightly, wrapping her head so she couldn't turn away.



The man who stepped out of bed headed towards the dressing room. Since he didn't close the door, Grace could see his back as he stood in front of the closet, putting on clothes.

Have you lost weight compared to before?


I finally thought that the contours of my muscles seemed more pronounced.


In the meantime, Ellie buried her face in Grace's chest and sniffled, shouting without knowing the real reason why her mom was holding me so tightly.

"I smell my dad on my mom."


Since she didn't like it, I thought she would tell me to wash up, but Ellie clung even more closely to her body and sniffed. Now Ellie's head was buried in her chest, turning bright red.

“Mom, let's play with dolls.”



"Mom, I want to sleep more. The sun hasn’t risen yet."
This was not the first time. That man, Grace, seemed to want to build a bond with the child that I alone could not encroach upon, as he would speak to the child in Northern language whenever there was a chance. Each time that happened, Grace felt excluded.



"I'm just teaching my daughter to talk."


Grace narrowed her eyes and glared at the man, but she couldn't come up with a retort. After spending the whole day with her dad, she couldn't deny that Eli's pronunciation and vocabulary had noticeably improved.

"Good night, Mom."


"Good night, Mom."


The child waved their hand and ran out to my dad. As soon as the door closed, whispered voices could be heard from outside.



"When mom is angry, she's really scary."


"How do you know? Has Ellie ever made Mom angry?"


"Yeah, but I still can't talk while smiling."


"What the hell have you done?"


Grace answered from under the blanket to the man who burst into laughter.


"I colored the walls and floors of the whole house with crayons."


In the quiet bedroom once again, Grace closed her eyes.


It had been so long since I had a deep sleep without being disturbed that I couldn't even remember when it had last happened.



Grace woke up and lingered in her blanket. The thought of checking if Ellie was doing well crossed her mind reflexively, but on the other hand, she felt that the man would be handling things just fine. It was reassuring yet bittersweet.



It was at a time when I was being lazy in bed until the sun reached the top of the sky. The door opened quietly.

Without even having to stick my head out from under the blanket, I could tell it was him.


"Mom, drink."



I looked up at the unexpected sound, and a man held out a tray with a teacup on it.
"Such stones are strewn around in the mine I possess."


Such a stone. To Grace and that man, this was no simple stone.


Means of escape.


That man probably knows the meaning as well. If he wants to stop fleeing, he must take away the means of escape. Then, there would be no need to waste time on futile persuasion. However, the man, knowing this, returned to Grace the means of escape that she could use to flee at any time.


As he gazed at her with eyes full of disbelief, he went to the bedroom and brought back the clothes Grace had been wearing. Then, as if she were Ellie, he began to dress her, something the man who had only been undressing her until now had never done.



It seemed as if the words he hadn't spoken could be heard from the diamond pouch placed in the center of the bra by the man.



I hope you choose me because you want to.


I don't want you.


Not understanding what she had said with her eyes, the man kept smiling brightly in the hallway leading to the living room.



"Did you get surprised a lot, darling?"





The fact that they didn't immediately mention that they put it in the safe is clearly a plot. At the moment I am deeply engulfed in distrust towards them, I want that distrust to come crashing down.

In the past, it gave hope and then despair. Now it gives despair and then hope. Wasn't he a man who loved dramatic psychological warfare more than anyone else?

“Come to think of it, you hid the fact that your brother also received diamonds as an inheritance. That means it's time to move to a smaller house.”

Grace, who had been glancing at the man, gasped in surprise and widened her eyes as soon as the living room door opened.



"Mom!"


Surrounded by women who looked like dressmakers, Ellie ran over here while looking in the mirror. At that moment, I understood why that man said he had to see it.

Ellie smiled contentedly as she looked in the mirror. The man said he had no choice but to use crystal because of the lightness he wanted, and he promised that when the child turned twenty, he would change the crown's crystal to real diamonds.



In the meantime, Grace's gaze was fixed on the fake crown abandoned on the table. It was the toy crown she had bought for Ellie. A shadow slowly fell over Grace's complexion.

It was then that I realized why I couldn't just be happy seeing my daughter draped in only the finest from head to toe.



“Mom, this all belongs to Ellie.”


The child pointed to the numerous dresses hanging on the portable clothes rack. They all had expensive decorations like beads and embroidery.

“Dad, Mom is making a princess dress too.”


"Could it be?"


"That's enough."


Grace quietly stopped the man who was trying to call the tailor so that Eli wouldn't hear.


"Ellie, Mom will be back after taking a bath."


"Why? Just take a look at this too."


“Let's take a bath first.”


I turned around after kissing the child who was shaking the hem of another dress hanging on the hanger, and my eyes met those of the man. His eyes were devoid of laughter.

Eli has developed a terrible habit of not locking the bathroom door while living with him. As she was filling the bathtub with water and sniffing, she turned around to find the man silently standing by the door, leaning against it and watching her.



"Go out."


But he didn't go out and sat down at the other end of the bathtub.


"I think I may have done something wrong, but I should know this first before I apologize."




"I tried to endure for Ellie because I like her...."


The man's hand came closer and brushed Grace's cheek. The tip of his thumb was wet.


“…You make my love seem insignificant.”


I'm sad about that.


Honestly, when I opened up, I even burst into tears. Grace, who is soon turning thirty, cried with her shoulders shaking like a child.



"The Doll's House is the same. If you buy it for me in one go, what does that make me, the one who didn’t buy it because it was too expensive? What about the Christmas gift I prepared? I won’t even look at such trivial things anymore."



I worked hard to earn money and saved to buy things, and even if they were shabby, I made them with love. Every time the child happily received everything Grace gave, I felt a sense of fulfillment as if I had become the greatest person in the world.



However, for Eli, who became rich with a wealthy dad, Grace's cheap love might become trivial. Eli's pure happiness and love are all that Grace has, and it feels as if everything has been taken away by the late-arriving child's father.

"I only have Ellie.... Ellie will now think that everything I do for her is insignificant."


"Speak sensibly."


The man who was comforting her suddenly got angry.


“Why don't you know Ellie when you raised her?”


Leon told the foolish girl, who thinks she is broke despite having what she does not want, about a child named Ellie that he had observed.



"Even if I buy dozens of dolls made by artisans, Ellie still sleeps holding onto the rabbit doll you made. When there's something delicious in front of her, she asks where her mother is. Even while playing well, she only looks for you, and if something happens, she goes to you and hugs you."


On the day we first met, the child said that it was the first time he had eaten lobster, and he suggested that his mother should try it too. Throughout the time we spent together, he only thought of his mother. Before she quit her job, even while playing excitedly, he would look at his wristwatch and ask where the hands needed to be for mom to come.



“You are still the person Ellie trusts and loves the most.”



He was someone who lost not only to Grace but even to the old rabbit doll that Grace had made for him. 'Dad'
"Easter."


The man taught the exact words, but the child's mind was completely captivated by explaining the gift.


"This is it!"


Ellie stretched her arms up as far as she could and made a wide circle.


"Receive a big chocolate rabbit."


What Grace bought me last Easter was no bigger than my forearm at most.


"And the inside of the chocolate is filled tightly with sweet candy."


The Easter Bunny chocolate is empty inside. Leon knows everything, but he decided to willingly fall for the cute little scammer.



"And Ellie is two years old."


As the child confidently held out two fingers, Grace chimed in, counting.


"Then there are two birthdays, two Easter celebrations, and two Christmases, so that makes six gifts?"


"Hey…."


The daughter, who proudly smiles after teaming up with her mom to extract a gift from dad, was simply adorable to Leon.



"Indeed, Winston Dower, who is born with greed in place of conscience."


Grace secretly twisted her eyes. Watching the man who was smiling proudly after receiving a kiss from his daughter, she felt an uneasy sensation as if she had been caught up in that man's scheme.

"Mom, but what about this?"


The child grabbed the ear of the muffin that was on her lap and lifted it up and down. When the parents couldn't understand, the child looked around restlessly and suddenly opened her eyes wide and ran towards the door.

"Major."



Just then, Campbell, who had come in to report to Leon, hesitated when the child ran up to me.
As a result of the observations over the last ten days, Grace had no choice but to reach a very uncomfortable conclusion.



The monster I created eventually became the human I made.


Nevertheless, I had no desire whatsoever to start anew with the 'human' Leon Winston who was reborn.


Jim had only come to pack because Ellie had decided to stay in the hotel until early next year. In fact, Ellie didn't need anything because that man had purchased everything for her. Grace packed her clothes and shoes and also put the camera in the bag.



"Is that mine?"


Under the tree, where no one had watered it for a while and the leaves were already falling, Ellie took out her Christmas present as a child came running over.

"This can be opened tomorrow morning."


"Huh…."


I know that since I chose it, it already has a toy pony inside. My dad promised to buy me a real horse, but Ellie wanted Grace's insignificant gift, just as the man said.

"I wish tomorrow morning would come soon."


"Then the circus."


When the man asked, Ellie immediately changed her words.


"Then I hope this evening comes quickly and tomorrow morning arrives!"


I decided to go see the circus this evening. It seems that if you have money and power, tickets that were unavailable suddenly become available.

Grace, who was making sure to grab the gift box and wondering if she had forgotten anything, caught sight of the man. He was looking at her and Ellie in the picture frame placed on the side table. Suddenly, the child, who had been looking at her dad, started to struggle and pulled out an album from under the side table.


"I won't take that."


The child shook their head in response to their mother's words. It was unclear whether it meant they were still going to take it or that they had no intention of taking it. Leon understood the meaning only after he took out the album.


“Jya.”
“Hmm… But then the prince won't recognize me.”


“If you leave just one shoe like this, the prince will come looking for you.”


As Leon quietly intervened, he watched the two playing with dolls.


“It's not shoes, but rather a report about the scenery that will be sought.”


As I mentioned the work on the passenger ship and eventually the trigger that led to the discovery, Grace subtly rolled her eyes.



"The game is coming to an end, and now slowly...."


It was just when Leon was about to tell them to get ready to go to the circus while looking at his wristwatch.


“Major.”


Campbell came. While the woman went to change the child's clothes, Leon received today's final report.


"Until now, there have been no new reports about the whereabouts of the four..."


The investigation into the assassination attempt is not yet complete. Last week, we secured testimony that four additional individuals—one middle-aged man, two young men, and one young woman—were seen coming and going from the warehouse where the remnants were staying. We have drawn up a rough sketch and tracked them, but there have been no results so far.



As Grace said, they may have already left this place.


“It's about contacting the Western Command and asking them to send photos or sketches of the major remaining members who have not yet been captured.”

The thought was to show it to the witnesses in order to secure an identity.


"Yes, I have already instructed it. However, since it is a holiday period, it may take some time."


As if to indicate that the answer was unsatisfactory, Campbell narrowed his eyes, and with a sheepish expression, cautiously pushed forward a thick folder.

"And here is the list of exhibits you mentioned. I have also prepared pictures."


It is good to be quick -witted after working under him for a long time, but I wondered whether the increasing ability to evade his scolding was really a good thing.

"Circus! I really want to see it."


The child sitting in the armchair between the two people bounced their feet, which did not touch the ground, while holding a rabbit plush toy in their arms.

"Wow!"


The performance soon began. Even Grace was so captivated by the extraordinary acts unfolding before her eyes.

However, the man was focused solely on the child and her throughout the entire show.


"Mom, over there, over there!"


Elli, who was excited to see the elephants and lions up close that she had only seen from afar at the zoo, tugged at Grace's sleeve. The child couldn't sit still in her seat and kept bouncing, often getting off the chair. The man had to catch the child a few times as she tried to approach the stage and sit her back down.


“Mom, bunny, bunny!”


Finally, the performance that Ellie had been looking forward to began. The magician, wearing a tall silk hat, came up on stage and bowed politely.

"Honorable gentlemen and ladies who have come to this place today…."


The magician, clearly having said these words hundreds of times, recited them smoothly as he approached. The man seemed to want to showcase the trick closely in front of the sole audience member, stopping only at the edge of the stage.



When he took off his hat, Ellie jumped down again under the chair. Since a lion wasn't going to come out of the hat, the two of them let the child approach the stage.

"Well, this gentleman has prepared a Christmas gift for the little lady."


"Cool!"


The child clapped their hands excitedly while clinging to the railing that came up to my chin. The moment the magician's hand, which had been dazzlingly teasing above the hat, slipped inside, the child's feet, which had been dancing on the floor, suddenly came to a stop.



"Ta-da!"


“Ugh!”



The child who was expecting a rabbit was startled and ran when a pigeon appeared.
"Is something stuck in the hoof?"


The watching caretaker took something out of the leather pouch tied to his waist. At that moment, Leon's face turned pale. Grace, who found it strange that his complexion suddenly changed, followed his gaze and turned pale as well.



It was a hook for trimming hooves, just like the one that the gang had.


The man quickly embraced Ellie and whispered instructions to the head of security. Receiving the signal to escape immediately from the dangerous place, the bodyguards surrounded the three of them in an orderly manner. Ignoring the bewildered looks of the members, everyone moved urgently toward the exit with serious expressions.


"Hello."


As Ellie waved her hand to the horse without knowing anything, the man wrapped one arm around Grace's waist and spoke.



“Stay close to me.”


Grace whispered to the man who took off my hat and placed it on the child's head while wrapping the child in his coat collar.



"I don't recognize that face."


That person might not be a remnant. But they could be a remnant. Grace doesn't know everyone's face.


I stepped into the lair of the remnants. No. Please, let it not be. I was trying to deceive myself, telling myself that I simply happened to possess the same item, and as I nervously took steps, it was then that I finally saw the exit right before me.



A pungent smell pierced the air. As soon as the security guard at the front lifted the curtain that covered the passage leading to the exit, flames surged from the passage and engulfed the curtain.

"Fire!"


The moment someone shouted, the venue was thrown into chaos. The security guards pushed through those rushing to extinguish the fire and those fleeing, leading the three directly to another exit.

However, unfortunately, the other exit was also blocked. Two men wearing gas masks were blocking the way with submachine guns in hand. At the same time, bullets rained down indiscriminately without any warning.

“Ugh!”



“Ahhh!”
"Mom!"


"Grace!"


We called out to each other, but we couldn't see one another. Half of the tent had collapsed, filling the remaining half with dirt and smoke, making it difficult to even keep my eyes open.

Grace walked toward the direction of the voice, but her feet kept tripping over the mass that felt like a body, causing her to stumble with every step. She crawled on the floor, calling for her daughter, but her voice was drowned out by screams and the deafening noise.



"Cough, cough."


At the time when I was coughing convulsively due to the suffocating smoke, I suddenly felt fresh air. Grace, who was groping toward the direction from which the wind was blowing, discovered a spot where it seemed someone had torn the tent.



"Ellie!"


She found the exit, but she couldn't escape alone. Grace kept calling for the child, but there was no response.


끼이이익.


The moment the ominous sound was heard, Grace knew without seeing. The tent would soon collapse.


As soon as I was forced out by an unavoidable choice, I ran to the nearest cover. It was just a moment before I tried to hide behind the enclosure of some animal.

A loud rumble shook the ground from behind, and flames soared high into the sky. Grace stood transfixed, gazing at the tent that had completely collapsed and was engulfed in the fire.

"No... No..."


In the midst of people fleeing in terror, face pale and screaming, there was no face that she was looking for. After frantically running around and confirming the survivors, Grace could only stand there in a daze, helplessly gazing at the blazing tent and the black ashes soaring above it.


“Black….”


It was the moment when a painful cry was about to burst out.


드르르르륵!



The sound of machine guns firing from a distance crossed the night sky.
was about to collapse.


"Mom, you’re here…."


The man forced a smile and whispered to the child.


"Uh, mom...."


The child finally opened her eyes and slowly lifted her head from where it had been buried in her father's arms. She sighed in relief as her legs relaxed. Grace, unaware of the pain in her knees from hitting the dirt ground, sat down and eagerly embraced the child.



The small body clinging to her trembled. She hated herself for feeling relieved that the child was trembling in fear, as it was evidence that he was still alive.

“…kind. Doesn't even cry.”


The man, perhaps feeling strained, grimaced and continued to speak hesitantly. The hand that was patting the child's head trembled slightly. Grace, who had been staring blankly at his face and blinking, shifted her gaze to the child and asked.



"Are you not in any pain?"


The child, perhaps too frightened, only shook their head vaguely instead of answering and burrowed deeper into her arms.



The pale hand that was wrapped around the child's head fell off Grace's arm with a thud. The moment his hand tried to grip her wrist, Grace stood up. The hand, which had been sliding off weakly, suddenly grabbed the child's ankle tightly.



The man tried not to let Ellie go. But now he didn't have the strength to defeat Grace. As he finally stood up, his hand fell away after futile resistance, and in the process, Ellie's shoe slipped off and dropped onto the man's hand.

Grace looked down at the man while holding Ellie. Then, suddenly, her face twisted as she took a step back.


The man picked up the gun that was lying on the floor.


You will die.


So you give up.


It was a time when I couldn't bear to say it out loud and conveyed it through my eyes, finally taking a step back.



The muzzle turned to the side....


Grace, who was flipping through the newspaper while having breakfast at the hotel restaurant, paused.


[Obituary: Count Leon Winston has passed away at the age of 31]


At that moment, the scene before her changed. The place she was in was a funeral home.


“Eli, what are you doing here?”


Grace ran to Eli, who was standing by the coffin in mourning clothes. The child turned to look at her, gazed at her with accusatory eyes, and said coldly.

"Mom killed Dad."


No. Ellie, it's not like that with mom.


Elli, who had been coldly watching her unable to speak out boldly and just awkwardly smiling, raised her hand to point at the coffin.



"I, I don't want to see you."


Something suddenly pushed her, who was holding her ground at that spot. Grace, stumbling in surprise, approached, and the moment her gaze met the wide-open coffin, she stopped breathing.


The person lying in the coffin was a boy.
[The criminals have not yet been captured, so it is dangerous. Miss Reed and her daughter are also targets for these scoundrels, so you must prioritize safety above all.]

Nancy, Fred's sister and Dave Wilkins' daughter, escaped despite being shot. The other remnants, except for the man he shot, were all unaccounted for.

[We will thoroughly protect you, so please....]


"I'll call again tomorrow."


Grace hung up the phone as soon as she finished her words.


As she went back up to the hotel room, Grace felt self-deprecating. It seemed ridiculous that she ran away yet called every day.



Looking back, that night was the same. She took an ambiguous attitude towards the man, neither wishing for him to die nor to live. Even as she abandoned him and ran away, she sought out the bodyguard to tell him where the man was.



Even if I stayed by that man's side, what would change? I'm not a god. I can't save a man who's dying.


No one blamed me, yet I acted as if I were making excuses. Returning to the room, Grace lay next to Ellie, staring blankly at the ceiling while lost in thought.

It has been a long stay for two days. I feel like I'm being tracked by Campbell, so I need to move to another city today.



Grace couldn't understand why Campbell, a soldier and royalist noble, was making such a fervent request to protect her and Ellie. For him, it would be advantageous for the government backed by his superior, which was made up of rebels, to disappear without a trace. Given the deep ties with the Winston family, the downfall of my superior would soon mean my downfall as well.



"Perhaps..."


While that man is still alive, he pretends to protect him, but the moment the man takes his last breath, she, who was a rebel, might be handed over to the army. She didn't even hope that her father, whom she only met once, would come to save her.



Moreover, for the Earl of Winston's family, Ellie would be a blemish that needs to be removed. Without him, and with Grace gone as well, there would be no one left in this world to protect Ellie.

I can't believe anyone but that man anymore. The fact that he has become someone I can trust is both astonishing and pitiful.



"Haah...."



Grace tied the ribbon she had untied to prevent the tossing Ellie from waking up around her wrist and brushed her
"Ellie?"


After paying for the magazine and chocolate, I turned around to find Ellie crouched in front of a pole three steps away. She seemed so engrossed in something. As Grace approached, she grimaced as soon as she noticed what was on the ground in front of the pole.



It was a mouse. Whether it was bitten to death by a cat or not, the mouse was soaked in dark red blood.


“Eli, don't look at things like this.”


Grace lifted the child who was staring blankly at the dead rat. The child looked up at her and asked, with a calmness that was almost ominous.

"Even Dad bleeds a lot like that. Right?"


It was only when she first mentioned that man that Grace realized why Ellie had wrapped a bandage around the leg of the stuffed bunny. The child knew exactly where her dad had been shot. She had been imagining treating it.

The sorrow felt toward the child seemed to squeeze the heart. At the same time, the shameful feelings toward that man had already mutilated a heart that could no longer be recognized.

Staring up at her with a demanding gaze, the child expected an answer, and Grace just moved her lips as if in a dream.



That's right. Your dad has bled so much that he might stop breathing at any moment. Perhaps tomorrow's newspaper will be filled with your dad's obituary.

I couldn't say such terrible words. I too was horrified, and Grace's mind went completely blank with terrible imaginations.



“Elli….”


Barely squeezing out her voice, Grace lied.


"That was a dream. It was a nightmare."


I foolishly hoped that you would forget what happened that night.


Grace's wish seemed unlikely to come true easily. That evening, the ominous premonition turned out to be correct, and Ellie’s condition drifted further away from her heartfelt desire.

Clang!



I accidentally broke a glass cup.
"When blood is stained, it feels unpleasant...."


The child, staring at the blood being sucked into the drain, muttered.


"Joah."


At that moment, Grace had a intuition.


I am becoming like my dad.


Like that man, the child, shocked by the ghastly appearance of his bloodied father, began to show an unusual fascination with the blood.



"Ellie...."


Grace hugged her daughter, who not only resembled my father but had also ended up repeating his fate. She silently prayed, suppressing her trembling so that the child would not sense her fear.

Please help me.


However, the only person who might know how to stop Eli's change could not provide any help.










Leon’s consciousness wandered endlessly through the same time like a mouse trapped in a maze.


The moment when the child's body temperature started to drop from him felt painfully slow. Just as the woman coldly pulled the child's ankle from his hand, Leon's body instantly grew cold.

The woman and child move away from him. The frozen ground and air of that time, and the gradually reaching touch of death, were not as cold as Grace's heart.

However, those turquoise eyes may simply be cold with fear. That tearful face might mean that the woman is just as sad.



In times like this, when hope is at stake, it inevitably returned to that initial moment when the woman mercilessly took the child away.




The only warmth in his life slips away from his embrace. Leon trembled in the cold.
"Ellie, mom is not going anywhere."


Grace held onto the child, suppressing her own urge to cry.


"Don't go. You can't go while I'm sleeping."


From that day on, the child tried to tie their hand to hers whenever there was a chance. They would go so far as to refuse to sleep if their hands were not tied together.

"Hu-ck…"


Grace's heart ached as she watched the two-year- old stifling tears with trembling shoulders. That night, perhaps they had been holding back their cries because she told them not to cry.

"Ellie, you can cry as much as you want. If you want to cry, then cry."


You are safe now. Nothing happened. That was a dream. So you can cry as much as you want.


Only then did the child feel relieved and burst into a sorrowful cry.


"I'm sorry... Mom, hic, I'm sorry."


As she comforted the crying child, Grace suppressed her own tears. How long had she wanted to cry since then? She hated herself for not being able to understand that feeling.

"Here, I don't want to! Ellie is going to our house!"


The child eventually burst out with emotions that had been held back. While it was more reassuring to express anger and throw a tantrum than to tremble quietly, the heart still ached just the same.

“Why can't we go home, black?”


For a sensitive child, wandering around the hotel room without knowing the reason would be anxious and difficult.

However, I couldn't explain to young Ellie the reason why she couldn't go home yet.


"Did our house burn down too?"


"No, Ellie. It was a dream."


We are traveling now. We are embarking with mom to find hope and happiness across the sea. We should have done this a long time ago.




It may not be paradise, but at least compared to this hell, it will be a paradise.
It was a refreshing sight for Campbell, but it was clear that someone would make noise if they saw it. So, he had gathered the torn letters and come to the bathroom.

I gathered the pieces of paper that had been thoroughly burned to ash in the sink, placed them in the toilet, and flushed. Pretending as if nothing had happened, I washed my hands and went outside, where the hospital director and the attending physician were standing in front of the hospital bed.


However, the patient was not in the hospital bed. While the employees of the count's family were packing, the major, standing by the window, had already dressed in his full uniform and was ready to leave.

"Indeed, as a soldier, your physical fitness is excellent, and your recovery is quick."


The hospital director expressed admiration with an exaggerated and obsequious manner. The major had just woken up from a coma a week ago after a month. Yet, approval for discharge had already been granted.

"I too have been unconscious for a long time, and this is the first patient I've seen with such a good prognosis. It truly can only be described as a miracle that there are no lasting disabilities."

The attending physician also assisted, but the Major remained expressionless the whole time. He lost his expression from the moment he heard the answer to the question as soon as he woke up.

"The woman and the child."


"All is well. However... I am on the run again."


I also reported that a call came every day from the woman, and she tried to persuade him to come to Winsford, but he didn’t budge at all.



“…I guess so.”


The major, having heard what happened, only muttered in a deeply submerged voice, neither getting angry nor issuing any orders to track it down. It was an ominous silence.

"Tomorrow there will be another call to the Special Assignment Team office, so this time I will make sure to succeed in the tracking."



However, the major gave an incomprehensible order to stop the pursuit, asking to relay only that he woke up when a call came in.



But after that day, the phone did not ring.


As the days without phone calls increased, an ominous silence persisted. The major had been silent for the entire past week.




Campbell watched the man, who was more corpse-like than the corpse itself, and thought.
After sending Campbell away, he took out a cigar as a habit and asked. It was a foolish thing to do.


Now, even when I smoked a cigar, I felt no taste or aroma. It wasn’t just the cigar. Barbiturate no longer tasted bitter either. So, should I say that this is a good thing?

The doctor said there is nothing wrong with the body, so it must be a psychological issue.


Am I going crazy?


It would have been better if I had gone crazy.


As the car raced towards Halewood, Leon thought.


Perhaps, after taste and smell, vision might also be dead.


The world reflected in his eyes was entirely gray.


As soon as Leon arrived at the mansion, he called for the butler.


"To provide the family of Pierce with double the salary for the 7 years he worked as a consolation payment."


As I was about to give the instruction, the moment I heard about Pierce's tragic news naturally came to mind. It was right after I opened my eyes and confirmed once again from Campbell the cruel reality that Grace and the child had left him.



"Call Pierce."


He asked to call him again, thinking like a fool that he should gather the relics of that woman and child, but for some reason, Campbell couldn't answer right away and revealed this.

“Pierce couldn't get out on the scene….”


The moment he heard the news that numerous people, including his attendant, had died on the spot, he became despondent.



Seeing that Grace had safely made it out, and recalling the sad events that followed, he found himself asking himself.



Why am I still alive?


The only person who should have died that day was Leon Winston.



Leon’s gaze deepened as he opened the bedroom door.
and remained vigilant of my surroundings. It was a time when that painful moment felt everlasting.


Grace has appeared.


The moment she felt relieved to see that she was safe, an intense pain was felt in her left thigh. However, the moment Grace calmly turned around with just the child, the pain moved to her heart.

Yeah, you don't love me.


Despite knowing, I kept foolishly hoping.


In that long time, I wished you would only look back on that one happy day, despite the fact that I gave you pain that would never disappear for a lifetime. I hoped you would believe, like I do, that we could live our lives forever like that day at Abington Beach.



I hope that clever you will let yourself be deceived like a fool by me.


Beyond being shameless, it was foolish.


I truly realized my blind wind only after becoming blind. Left alone, he tried to gauge whether what was changing into darkness was the world or his own vision, but even that was difficult for him.

And even now, I am unable to mock myself.


Once again, I was abandoned by that woman.


It makes sense.


He has just begun to feel that this life is no different from a hamster wheel, and no matter how hard he tries, he only replicates the same tragedy.

There is only one way to escape this vicious cycle. It was for Grace to return by herself.


However, that clever woman would never return to a fool like that.


Not only did I realize too late that it was a trap, but I also missed three of the remaining accomplices. In such a situation, it would be hard to believe that telling them to come back because it’s dangerous since the remaining accomplices are still on the run.



Knowing that where he lives is a battlefield, he still tried to enjoy peace in the midst of the shelling. He had hoped to make up for the tragedy of Christmas three years ago, but in fact, it was the enemy who made up for that tragedy.



Like three years ago, both Christmas and New Year's were ultimately spent alone, waking up on a cold hospital bed was the inevitable outcome for a fool.

As the snow that had been falling all day stopped, the quiet slum came to life. The adults grabbed shovels and brooms, while the children held sleds and snowballs.

Grace sat on the steps in front of her house, sharing cheap coffee with the ladies who lived in the same alley.


"Where did you buy it?"


A middle-aged woman sitting behind her poked Grace's shoulder and asked in a clumsy pronunciation.


"Yes?"


"Uh... last year?"


"Ah, where did you live?"


The woman nodded her head.


"From a far place here."


Grace looked down the hillside, stumbling through a conversation with the neighboring women, who she couldn't communicate with well, using just a few words.

On the dock below, laborers were continuously carrying sacks, while beyond them, a flock of seagulls was flying over the dark blue sea.



This place was the immigrant district of the port city where I used to live with Ellie. As soon as the new year arrived, Grace returned here with Ellie. It was a choice made in the hope that having familiar faces around might help the child find some stability.



And fortunately, it was an excellent choice.


A child who was playing and chatting in Northern language among the neighborhood kids, who were at least a hand's breadth taller than me, ran over to Grace.

"Mother."


"Mom."


"Elly, water please."



"This is coffee."
The moment Grace called, the man sitting in front of the iron table in the torture room turned his eyes towards her and raised one eyebrow slightly.

"I have a question."


“It's free to ask, but don't forget that freedom comes with responsibility.”


The man laughed as he spoke in a boring, teacher-like manner. He was already drunk. So he decided to ask this trivial yet always curious question.

“Why did you want to name the dog you raised as a child Bella?”


"Because it was a dog whose name suited its meaning well."


Bella meant beautiful. It was the most ordinary answer, and Grace became even more confused.


“Then why do you call me that?”


The man smiled and put down the bottle of alcohol, picking up a cigar.


“Bella, Countess Trixie, Dolly. Anyway, I liked that dog.”


I thought it was a turning point, but it wasn't.


Daisy, Sally, Grace. Whatever it is, I like you.


As those words were interpreted in her mind, Grace felt deeply why she had always postponed such trivial questions.



"Are you curious about what happened to Bella?"


"No."


He rejected it with a sense of ominous foreboding, but the man devoid of mercy smiled with twisted lips, holding a cigar.



“That foolish dog ran away when I was eight years old. It escaped through the open employee entrance and was hit by a passing carriage and died.”

Leon Winston was a monster who neither knew how to cherish life nor respect it. I expected him to laugh when hearing the news of someone's death, but his face instead hardened. It even felt as if he was experiencing a sense of loss.

The man on the other end of the receiver was silent. Only once, on a day when rain poured down, did a sigh, like the sound of wind brushing against her ear, reach her. In the end, it was Grace who broke the silence first.

"Hello."


Hello, darling.


Did I unknowingly expect that brazen greeting? The moment I heard a sound from the receiver that was completely unexpected and not at all brazen, Grace had to stifle the tears that were about to burst from me with her hand.

Just like we practiced. Please speak just like we practiced.


Grace forcefully suppressed this absurd emotion and brought forth the words she had practiced, spitting them out.


"Lift the travel ban. If you are truly sorry, let us go."


There was no sound on the other end of the receiver. If it belonged to this man, even the silence felt persistent.


"If you really love Ellie, shouldn't you pull that child out of this pit of blood and revenge?"


The man finally broke the silence. It was nothing but meaningless chatter, not an answer.


[Ellie… How have you been?]


He let out that brief remark while taking a pause. It was silently conveyed that he was suppressing something with each syllable. Grace tightly shut her eyes and steadied her mind, uttering a word that could shake him.

"Ellie, I've also started to obsess over blood like you."


The breath that could be heard over the receiver paused for a moment, and then he asked with a trembling voice.


[Where are you now?]


"Now I'm okay. I've returned to the old Ellie. Instead…."


[Ha....]


"Ellie has forgotten you."



A sigh of relief stopped as if cut by a knife.
conquest.


The vampire of Camden. The rumors were widespread, so I was期待していたのに….


It's not that impressive.


And he will leave, just as he did, with only a cold sneer left behind.


However, now that the moment she had longed for has arrived, Grace could not smile.


[I'll take all the unhappiness for myself... I hope you and Ellie will be happy. I'm really sorry for ruining your happy life...]



While Grace was left speechless, the man, seemingly resigned to his end, spilled out his long-held feelings with a sob he could no longer suppress.

[As an unwelcome guest, I was arrogant enough to think I could become a part of that happy family… but I only realized that there was no place for me there. If we had never met again, perhaps neither you nor I would be in such pain….]



He could not continue speaking and let out a sigh.


[Ellie... really... to the point of suffering....]


Even without saying it, the pain was vividly felt in the voice that seemed to be squeezed out.


[Lovely...]


He was unable to continue speaking once again. Grace swallowed her own words as she heard the sound of him swallowing his tears.



After quite some time, a deep breath was heard, followed by a calm voice that seemed to have gathered its emotions.



[I thought about that. If I had acted differently from the beginning, could I have prevented you from leaving again even if I devoted everything to you? The door is already closed, and I foolishly reflected in front of the closed door.]

He began a lengthy confession.


[You might not be curious, but let me make an excuse....]


If I can't possess your love, I wanted to at least hold onto that terrible hate. Even if you smile, I want you to suddenly think of me and grit your teeth, so that you can't let me go, even from afar.

[Should I confess honestly? Right now, I'm calculating how I should behave to weaken your heart. Should I act pitifully, or persuade you logically?]

A self-deprecating laughter was heard. No, upon closer listening, it seemed like it wasn't laughter.


[Look. I still have no conscience, so I can't let go of my greed for you.]


Yes, that's Winston. The fact that he is thinking at this moment makes me bitter, not angry, as I find solace in the familiar act.



[You can't just pass by when you see a poor person, can you? Do you know that I wish you would say you want to go with me, even if it's out of pity for me?]

Leon Winston knows Grace Riddle too well. From the moment she confessed she liked him while apologizing for her father's actions, to the moment she handed Ellie over to him. The underlying foundation of the moments he became weak for this man was a sense of compassion for him.


[But what I'm saying is all sincere. Please believe this.]


Grace also knew Leon Winston very well. So she was no longer swayed by his antics. The reason she was shaken now was that everything he said tonight was sincere.

"Leon...."


Grace called him and for a moment couldn't find the words. The words tangled on her tongue. However, she would not say what he was hoping to hear.

"Ellie has forgotten you."


He brought me back to reality once again with the man who shakes me.


"Your place is now gone."


Although there was a place for him in Eli's heart, it has disappeared.


"We will never leave together."


The only reason they couldn't be together wasn't that Ellie had forgotten him.


"I will confess honestly too."



Grace let out a sigh as overwhelming as her confession.
"Well, I hope we can put the past behind us and go our separate ways now."


I will put aside my pathetic and strange desires. Then someday I will be able to read about you in a magazine and smile.



"Please...."


A heavy sigh was heard, and the answer I had been waiting for came through even fainter than the sigh.


[Yeah....]


The man who never listened to her pleas grants her last wish. Even though it perfectly contradicts his own desires.


[Goodbye.]


A tear flowed down Grace's cheek as she heard the farewell crafted from choking sorrow and resignation.


When I first escaped from the annex, I shed tears of joy, savoring the fleeting freedom. Why do the tears I shed now, having finally attained complete freedom, feel so different in meaning?

In the meantime, farewell greetings continued over the receiver.


[Lastly, I'm sorry. I won't forget everything I did to you, so I hope you can forget. It was a short time, but I was happy. Thank you.]



As the greeting filled with suppressed sadness ended after a long pause, it was Grace's turn.


Goodbye.


He called Grace, who couldn't say that easy farewell and was hesitating.


[Grace.]


“…Why?”


[Before you leave, grant me just one wish.]


As it has always been, I thought there would be a trap here, but Grace could not help but listen.


"Say it."

done to Grace.


[It's becoming hard to slowly die from your hopeful torment. It's better to be forever lost than to be left with only the vain hope that I might regain what I've lost. But if that hope is gone, I have no reason to live, so if you leave like this, I'll be left alone, repeating the foolish act of clinging to futile hope.]


One day, will I偶然 run into you? Will Ellie remember me when she grows up and come looking for me? He prayed again, suffering from that hopeless hope, saying that he felt like he was dying day by day.


[So please just kill me all at once.]


The sound coming through the receiver resembled the sound that had escaped from the constricted throat of the day she had hung in the noose.

At that moment, I wished for you to save me, but you ask for me to kill you.


[I know it's hard to come this far. Just one word saying to die is enough. I'll take care of the troublesome things.]





[Please.]


He granted her final wish, which conflicted with my desires, but Grace could not bring herself to do so.


"Leon…."


What should I say? Having called his name out of the blue to hold him back, I'm now searching for the right words, when suddenly someone knocked on the booth's door from outside.

"It's time to close the door."


It was the voice of the tavern owner. Has it already become that time? Grace snapped back to reality and got up.


"I need to go see Ellie. I'll call again tomorrow."


[…I will wait.]


I felt relieved by the words "I will wait" and hung up the phone. Little did I know it would become another round of cruel torture.







Today was a gloomy day as if it were going to rain. Grace handed a marble cookie, baked in the morning, to the child's hand.



I stood by the window for a moment, watching the child munching on the cookie, and then picked up the iron again. As my body repeated the familiar motion, my thoughts inevitably drifted towards the conversation that had been repeating in her mind all day.



[Yes, I still love you. That's why I'm unhappy.]


How can you still love me, who left you while you were dying?


I knew you would get angry. I knew you would pour out your resentment. I thought you would either burn with love and hate like before, or that love would die that day and only hatred would survive.

Why is a smart man, so far from foolishness, behaving like this?


Her behavior that differs from what Leon Winston knows did not stop there.


The man, shaped by greed, gave up his desire for Grace. Just because she asked him to.


"I can let go of all my other desires, but I can't let go of my desire for you."


They say it can't be thrown away someday.


What have I done to you?


Grace let out a deep sigh and glanced sideways at Ellie.


Shall we put [them] to bed a little earlier today?


The words "I will call you back" were not mere empty words. However, I couldn't grasp at all what I wanted to say or what I should say. I was envious of that man who always seemed to know exactly what to say.

I don't know about other things, but I know this. If he doesn't call as promised, it seems he will take extreme measures.



He was a man who always did extreme things. It wouldn't be a big deal if he did it to Grace, but if he were to do it to someone he loved more than anyone else, it would be shocking.

No, seeing that he protected Ellie until the end even while being shot, it might be wrong to say that the person who loves her more than anyone is himself.


“Haah….”
"I won't do it! Open it again!"


It was from that time. Ellie became sensitive to everything all day long and was irritable.


"Uaaah!"


I spilled milk and cried that I had spilled it. When I took off the clothes soaked in milk and changed into new ones, I cried that I didn't want to wear them because they had wrinkles in a shape I disliked, and I wondered if my obsession with cleanliness and compulsions were also hereditary.


"No, Ellie."


"Why not, aaaaaah!"


Is it really such a sorrowful thing that I couldn't bring the blanket from the bed to the living room? I picked up the crying child along with the blanket and laid them down on the bed.

It was nap time, so I held and patted them, and although the crying stopped, they kept tossing and turning without sleeping. Eventually, they burst into tears again because they couldn't touch their mom's chest. When Grace slightly moved while they were dozing, they also got annoyed.


I was fine lately, but why am I like this today?


The child, who had been crying non-stop throughout the house, finally fell into a deep sleep. Grace, also completely exhausted, dozed off for a moment and only opened her eyes around sunset.

The child was deeply asleep, even sweating. She, who urgently needed to relieve herself, carefully got out of bed so as not to wake the child and went to the bathroom. However, her freedom didn't last long.

"Mom!"


Ellie started to cry while banging on the bathroom door.


"Yeah, Mom, I'm here."


"Come back to bed!"


If it had been any other time, the child would have simply opened the door, but now they kept knocking on the unlocked door, which only looked like a fit of rage. What on earth were they angry about? My head was throbbing.

"Then come in."



"Go away! Mom, come out!"
The child wrapped both hands around her neck and rested their head on her shoulder, whispering weakly.


“Hold me, okay?”


It was that night that I realized there was a reason why Ellie was strange.


I thought I was just getting a fever, but in an instant, it was boiling hot. It seemed like a cold.


He was a child who had never been sick since birth. That’s why both I and Grace didn’t know that Ellie was throwing a tantrum because she was unwell.

"Ellie, you have to."


"Let's go see the doctor when the sun rises tomorrow."


"I don't want to. Eli, I don't want to."


The child, having experienced vaccinations before, was frightened at the thought that they might receive an injection at the hospital, knowing that needles hurt. Grace had a different fear.

I need to go to the hospital.


The night was too long. On one hand, it was also too short.


I need to call that man.


However, I couldn't leave Ellie, who was in pain. I hoped Ellie would fall asleep before the tavern closed. But the child couldn't easily fall asleep.

They cooled the fever with a cold wet towel all night and boiled water for him to inhale the steam. Still, the fever wouldn't go down, and the coughing grew worse. He even ended up vomiting the little soup he managed to eat. By this point, the man was completely forgotten in Grace's mind.


It was the time when the towel, which had quickly become lukewarm, was being changed to a new one on the forehead of the boiling child. The child, with eyes blurred by high fever, called out to Grace while staring at her blankly.



"Mom."


"Uh?"



"How do you get to heaven?"
"Mom will bring Dad."


Hey, the child smiled. She finally let go of her that she hadn’t released all day long.


“Black….”


As soon as Grace stepped outside, she burst into tears that she had been holding back.


Now I understand why the child looked out the window every day. I also understand why they would stop whatever they were doing and not take their eyes off when a black sedan passed by.

The child had been waiting for Dad.


I understand why you said you weren't seeing anything when asked what you were looking at.


I can't see Dad.


“Black, I'm sorry….”


She hurriedly ran down the stairs, sobbing.


Grace committed the sin of taking lightly the weight of the child's heart, just as the adults had when she was young.


After returning from Abington Beach, if someone had listened to her story, many things would have been different.

But she had no trustworthy adults.


Eli needed someone to listen to him.


I promised my daughter that I would be a trustworthy adult for her, but in the end, I was just a foolish adult.


“Eli, that was a dream. You had a nightmare.”


I had momentarily relaxed, thinking that I had prevented myself from becoming a monster obsessed with blood like that man, treating it as if it never happened. In reality, I was teaching my child my own bad habit of always running away from issues that were difficult to handle.



To think you would impose a brainwashing on the wounds as well. Knowing well what happens when a wound doesn't heal and only festers until it bursts.

When things are peaceful, it was easy to mimic the role of a "good mother" that I had never experienced before.

However, when a crisis occurs, the true face is revealed.

I read an article about that wretched man who survived being shot and fled. It was not uncommon to come across wanted posters for Nancy, the only one among the three whose identity was revealed.

So they waited until the late hours of the night when there were few people around and then launched their surprise attack. They overpowered Grace at the entrance of the building and dragged her home, throwing an old duffel bag at her and ordering her to pack her things.


Where on earth are you going to take me, and what do you want me to pack for?


With anxiety came a sense of relief as well. The fact that they needed a burden meant they didn't intend to kill right away.



However, in doing this, Ellie….


"Mom..."


엘리’s voice calling her was hoarse. Grace hugged Elie tighter, who was looking around with anxious eyes, so that she couldn't see anything.


"It's okay."


"Elly, cough, at home...."


The child couldn't even finish the words about wanting to go home and started to sob quietly. They sensed that the atmosphere was unusual. I felt overwhelmed with guilt for the child suffering due to having the wrong parents.

"Ellie, I'm sorry. Mom will be talking with a friend for a bit, so you can go back to sleep."


Grace whispered to Ellie to soothe her so that the child wouldn’t feel anxious and began to act.


"Long time no see."


It was really a calm tone as if Nancy was pretending to be a friend. Of course, Nancy, who had no intention of accommodating the child, scoffed as if it was absurd.

"Tell me what you want."


Compassion and begging do not work. However, transactions might. Grace was only thinking of giving Nancy what she wanted and taking the child to the hospital as soon as the sun rose.

"Does that mean you have the ability to grant me anything I desire?"


Nancy, standing with her arms crossed, stepped forward and laughed as she pressed the barrel of her gun against the jaw of the dirty traitor.

On the 3rd anniversary of the day comrades fell, the leader walks into my front yard on his own feet.


This is the will of God.


Nancy began sharpening the blade of vengeance once again.


Of course, that Leon Winston is at the circus on Christmas Eve. I had a strange feeling about it.


The question was resolved as soon as the other two audience members revealed their identities.


"I thought it was an opportunity given by God to handle everything at once. How terrible they are."


Nancy said that and shifted her gaze, which had been glaring at Grace, to the child in her arms. It meant she was even thinking of killing the innocent Ellie.

The one who doesn't die incredibly is you.


Grace patted the child's back more quickly so that Nancy wouldn't see her hands trembling with anger and fear.


"How shameless to laugh and enjoy on the day comrades fell. You must have laughed like that even while watching the comrades being slaughtered."

Comrade. Comrade. How amusing. As if there is some great camaraderie. I'm just selling out my ideals and comrades for the sake of family revenge.

Grace wanted to pour out freely like before, but she had to hold back for Ellie.


“Nancy, you’re misunderstanding. I was just being forced to stay with that man.”


She pushed the hat down on the child's head to cover the ears. Ellie was too young to notice the lies told to survive.


"I ran away leaving Winston behind, you saw it with your own eyes that day. Don't you see me hiding in the slums?"


"Don't joke around. On that day when I was shot, I kicked my gun away and ended up saving that devil."


"Don't forget. It was me who saved you by telling them that Anga was caught by the military."


I shouldn't have done that. At least I should have confirmed Nancy's death before fleeing from that man. What good is that pathetic conscience? What is the resolution not to kill anymore worth now?

From Elly, who hasn’t cooled down, to the man who will wait for her call all night long. The lives of both are in danger because of my past misjudgment.

“How about making a deal with that man to get it released? You already have two negotiation cards.”


Nancy said something like this a little while ago.


"Grace Lee's dog would sure bite its owner's neck."


It seemed that she believed the man wanted Grace the most. Then, her prediction was that he would leave the most important card, Grace, here and send the less important child as bait to open the negotiation.

"I will actively cooperate, so if things go well, please forget the lingering resentment from the past and let me go."


I pretended to wish sincerely, but in truth, I didn't care whether they let me go or not. It was just a smokescreen to keep Nancy from realizing that it was all just a ruse to get Ellie out of here.

"You know that your father killed Winston's father, so you can guess that that man won't go easy on him, right?"


It communicates. The face of Nancy, who had been smirking all along, grew serious. To make matters worse, she crossed her arms and wandered in front of me, showing signs of inner conflict.

After a moment of contemplation, Nancy paused and then smiled.


"I heard such rumors from an old comrade who has been released. You said you were keeping my father alive until I was caught? Then what, I have nothing to worry about?"

Damn it. Nancy wasn't as stupid as my sister.


What is your purpose anyway?


Grace held the child tightly, holding her breath in front of the contemptuous gaze directed at me.


Since around sunrise, I pleaded. Please send the child to the hospital. I asked to leave this here and just bring the child back.



However, no matter how much he begged, the three did not listen. Uncle Bobby only left a kettle of ice water and a towel.



The fever dropped compared to last night, but the cough and body aches became worse. Ellie, who was groaning, murmured.



“Mom's friend is annoying. Don't play.”


Grace lay on the bed, patting Ellie. In her mind, all sorts of plans were being made and then collapsed repeatedly.

Hope and despair intertwined.

The child complained of a sore throat and could hardly swallow the bread, only managing to take a few sips of milk. Even that made them anxious, fearing they might vomit. Fortunately, Ellie had just taken cold syrup and soon fell into a deep sleep.



The sound of wheezing breaths was painful to hear. Grace, who rubbed menthol ointment on the child's chest to make breathing easier, absentmindedly rubbed her tired eyes.

My eyes stung. The moment tears welled up, the tears that had been building inside burst forth like a dam breaking.


"Black…."


The uncle who had been sitting a little farther away and watching let out a sigh and left. A moment later, he returned holding a steaming teapot and cups.

"Thank you."


Grace found herself in a position where she had to thank the person who had kidnapped me. The uncle sat back down on the chair in the corner of the basement and muttered while staring at the sleeping Ellie.

“At this time of year, colds used to circulate among the village children. I remember when our daughter caught it and then you caught it, and that poor Hetty suffered quite a bit.”

When my mother was away from home due to operations, the neighborhood ladies took turns taking care of Grace and my brother. I also have memories of being indebted to Aunt Hattie, who is the wife of the uncle.

However, according to Grace's memory, Mr. and Mrs. Hattie did not have any children.


The uncle watched the two without going outside. It didn't feel like surveillance. At least among the three, Uncle Bobby seemed warmhearted, so I thought I should try talking to him.

Grace sat down at the table in the middle of the basement after buttoning up Ellie’s pajamas, who was soundly asleep, and giving her the muffin again. It was a seat facing the uncle.

"Isn't Aunt Hattie with you?"


"I've been staying at the hospital these days."


For reasons unknown, Aunt Hattie would suddenly suffer from mania every winter. Because of this, Grace was aware that she frequently came in and out of a mental hospital.

“Now that I’m being discharged, I have nowhere to go….”



I didn’t need to ask why. It was because of Grace that I lost my home.
Listening to the uncle's sympathetic words, my doubts grew even more. He was not part of the leadership, but he had been devoted to the revolution for a long time. From the fact that he had warned Grace to leave in advance, it was clear that he knew the dirty secrets of the Blanchard rebels and had also felt disillusionment.


Then why do they still remain as rebels?


"Uncle."


"Um?"


“Then why are you helping Nancy?”


The uncle smiled bitterly at Grace's sharp question.


"I need Hattie’s hospital expenses."


"Oh...."


“It was originally Jimmy who provided it, but now that guy can't give it anymore. With my old body, I can't afford that money. I never thought that accepting his offer to send me to a good hospital would end up holding me back.”

The uncle let out a weak laugh and sighed deeply.


"There can't be any noble ideals left. I'm a helpless coward, lacking even the desire for revenge."


The uncle coughed for a moment and then continued speaking.


"You might be wondering why I'm standing here in this dirty mire when you told me to leave. Grace, I can't say I'm completely clean myself. By the time I realized I had taken the wrong path, I had already come too far."

"There is no such thing as too late to turn toward the right path, sir."


It was shameless of me to say this, having said the exact same thing to Uncle Bobby, but there was no helping it.


"The uncle still has a way to wash away his sins and live peacefully with Aunt Hetty."


The uncle raised one eyebrow. It was evidence that he was interested in such a life. Grace lowered her voice while listening to the noise coming from upstairs.

“Take Ellie with you without anyone else knowing. If you bring her to Winston, he will grant you freedom for Uncle and Aunt Hetty and will also give you a new identity and money. I promise you.”

The children thought it was a mask game, but in reality, they covered their faces because they were impulsively concerned that they might harm the child, seeing a face so similar to that man’s.

"Come with me."


The door burst open, and as expected, the young man and Nancy stormed into the basement.


"Leave the child."


“Eli, wait a moment, I’m playing alone.”


Grace sighed in relief and kissed Ellie on the forehead. Ellie glanced at the two people standing by the door and nodded without throwing a fit.

"I'll be right back."


She quietly followed the two people so that the child would not be startled. Once she stepped outside, out of Eli's line of sight, she could not fight against those wielding guns and daggers with her bare hands and was dragged away.



They dragged Grace to the bathroom on the second floor and made her sit in a chair. Soon, her limbs were tied up with ropes.



From that time on, torture solely for the purpose of revenge began.


"They said a young blonde woman entered the theater when Uncle Bobby was planting the bomb. They said he might have been caught. And then he really was caught."

Nancy glared at Grace, lifting her dyed blonde hair with the tip of a dagger.


"Was it you?"


“No, I wasn’t there.”


It was a lie that didn’t even need to be told. Nancy was the type to blame Grace even if an ant died on the other side of the world. She had no intention of listening to Grace’s explanations or excuses.

“After chasing around like a dog to protect Winston, you say you're not on the same team? Don't be ridiculous.”


“Ugh….”


With her eyes rolling, Nancy, who was beating Grace indiscriminately, grabbed her by the hair painfully and, baring her teeth like a mad dog, asked.

"Vicious woman."


Nancy glared at Grace with a resentful look and slapped her cheek.


"How can you not make a sound at all?"


Because Ellie shouldn't hear it.


I know that the longer I endure, the more cruel the torture will become. However, I could not let Eli hear sounds that would torment him for a lifetime.

Grace bit down harder on her teeth, trembling slightly, as she recalled how terrifying the sound of the torture had been on her last night at Abington Beach.

“I have to show this state to that demon.”


Nancy picked up the nail that was on the floor and smiled.


"Shall I try sending this to him?"


Sure, go ahead. Please let that man know that we are being held by you.


I know that Nancy wouldn't do that. As expected, instead of sending the nail, she threw it back at Grace's feet.

However, Grace, who was observing Nancy's complexion, felt relieved rather than frustrated.


That man, nothing's wrong.


If he had made an extreme choice, they would have already been unable to contain themselves and would have either made a fuss or reacted in some way. However, there were no signs of that at all.

However, the relief did not last long.


"Did I tell you? When I found you and that bastard who got shot, I was planning to kill your daughter first. Right in front of both of you."



Nancy laughed as she pretended to cut her neck with a blood-stained pair of nippers.


"Next, I was planning to kill you. Winston, that devil watches as his daughter and mistress die right before his eyes. Helplessly. Clearly with both eyes."

Now I can't tell who the devil is. Grace's body trembled like a aspen again, terrified that someone might try to kill Ellie right in front of me.

"So roughness is not my style."


He explained why he didn’t ambush her in the bathroom but brought her to the bed, and then he laughed awkwardly.



"However, the woman holding the baby and trembling in fear turns out to be my type. I wonder if they'll understand if I say that a protective instinct has arisen?"

Despite helping to torment her instead of stopping Nancy, he said he felt a protective instinct towards Grace.


It is merely an impulse to suppress the weak and taste the thrill of conquest.


The small-statured man, who appears somewhat timid, has clearly lived as a weakling in society his whole life. He has captured an opportunity from Grace to overturn the dynamic of strength versus weakness, which he has never been able to win.



"Nancy cursed you for being cruel, but I know. You're holding back your pain because your daughter doesn’t want to hear you cry, right? Then she wouldn't want to hear the sounds coming from the bed either."

The guy who was sitting on the dresser stabbed a dagger into his back pocket and began to approach Grace while unbuckling his belt.



“If you stay quiet, I’ll finish quickly.”


The man demanded that Grace take off her clothes as well. She pretended to comply and brought her hands to her blouse.



"You've thought well. Nancy said you are smart, and that’s true. Do you have any thoughts about living with me? I’m actually lonely. I could convince Nancy to let you live."

He came right up to me and didn't shut his mouth for a single moment while pulling down his pants. It became increasingly difficult not to make a face as if I wanted to kill him.

Grace froze for a moment and frowned as she unbuttoned the second button of her blouse.


"My hand hurts. Can you do it for me?"


Then she lifted the hem of her dress above her knees. The guy leaned down and reached out to untie the garter strap holding the stocking band. Grace spread her legs and demanded.

"Just tear it."



The man knelt before her, a filthy smile on his face, at the command not to remove the bloomer but to tear it.
As soon as Nancy came out, she grabbed the gun tucked at her waist, cut her throat, and searched for the key. It wasn't long after rehearsing in her mind that the opportunity arose.

Suddenly, the sound of chopping stopped, and Nancy mumbled.


“Why is it so quiet?”


It seemed that they had just realized that the sounds of wrestling or crying were not heard from upstairs. Following the sound of a knife being placed on the cutting board, footsteps approached the entrance as if they were going to check.



Damn it.


As soon as Nancy revealed herself, Grace's plan fell apart. Nancy was holding a pistol in her right hand.


“Oh my!”


As Nancy tried to turn the gun towards her, Grace slashed the finger holding the gun with a dagger.


"Ah!"


Nancy's fingers naturally opened, and she dropped the gun. Grace, not giving Nancy a chance to act foolishly again, tightened her grip around her neck with her left arm. She attempted to stab her in the neck with a dagger, but it kept embedding itself in Nancy's forearm instead. The same happened when she tried to stab her in the chest. The knife repeatedly missed the vital spots and lodged itself elsewhere.


"Yuck!"


The owner of this scream was Grace. Nancy twisted her left little finger. The pain struck her body like lightning.


The moment I realized, Nancy loosened the arms wrapped around her neck and broke away. As my dizzying vision became clear, I saw Nancy running towards the end of the hallway.

“Ugh!”


As Nancy reached to pick up the pistol that had flown to her feet, she was yanked by her hair and thrown back. The moment she saw the wild gleam in the turquoise eyes, a dagger came flying toward her neck.

퍽.


Grace, who was struck by Nancy's swinging arm, dropped her dagger. The black blade, slicing through the air, fell and rolled down the stairs leading to the underground.


Grace sat on Nancy, who was trying to get back up in the gap, and swung her fists.
"Nancy, no!"


퍽.


“Gasp!”


A solid object struck the back of her neck. As the shock made her vision spin, Grace's legs went weak and she sank down. Clang. The brass candlestick fell to the floor and rolled around.

"What are you doing!"


The sound of the uncle's scolding Nancy grew fainter and fainter. Grace clung desperately to her fading consciousness and repeated one name.

Eli.


"Ellie!"


Grace, even after losing consciousness, opened her eyes wide while shouting a name she could never let go of. The world in front of her spun around, and she felt nauseous. At the moment her consciousness became dim again, she heard the voice of an uncle beside her.



“Nancy, that crazy one.... If you’re going to pull it out, you should pull out that devil's nails.”


I became fully awake. When I opened my eyes wide, everything around me was dark. Turning my head, I saw Uncle Bobby holding the steering wheel. Grace was sitting in a truck driving down the dark road.

"Ellie!"


Startled, Grace quickly regained her composure and frantically looked around the inside of the truck. But Ellie was nowhere to be found.



“Uncle, where is Ellie?”


The uncle simply let out a deep sigh while looking at the road.


"How's Ellie doing?!"


It was only when the furious Grace tried to grab him by the collar that the uncle spoke up.



"Stay safe in the basement."
As soon as the words were spoken, a truck came to a stop in a quiet alley near the train station. The man pulled out his wallet and handed a few crumpled bills to Grace.

"Receive."


Grace clung to the uncle without receiving any money.


“Uncle, instead of sending me, please send Ellie. What has that child done to deserve this? If you want to take revenge, you can do it to me! You can pull out my nails or cut off my fingers. If that's still not enough, go ahead and kill me. It doesn't matter what you do, just please send the child back to my dad!”


I begged and wailed while holding onto him, but the uncle did not even glance at Grace; he simply picked up her coat that had fallen to the floor and stuffed bills into his pocket.

"Sir, please. Save my daughter."


The uncle let out a long sigh and shook his head.


"Uncle!"


“I’m not sending you away.”


"Yes?"


"Moreover, I have no intention of seeking revenge. Nancy is different, though."


"Then why on earth are you doing this?"


"Take revenge for Nancy. Then Nancy will also resolve her grudge and let you and your daughter go."


The uncle reached back from his seat, took something out, and placed it on Grace's lap. It was a violin case.


"I will take good care of your daughter, so just think about what you need to do."


As soon as Grace saw the violin case, she realized the meaning of revenge that the uncle had spoken of, and her hands began to tremble uncontrollably.

"When I hear the news that you have succeeded, I will place an advertisement in the National Tribune to inform you of the time and place of our meeting. This is all I have to say. Now you may go."

However, Grace was frozen in place and couldn't move. The man, who had been staring out the car window, spoke in a reassuring tone to the frightened child.


"It's not a difficult task, is it?"
The moment I left Ellie all alone flickered before my eyes. The most precious child in the world gazed at her eagerly with tear-filled turquoise eyes through the gap of the shabby paper bag she was wearing.

"I'll be right back."


The child's eyes spoke to her, who made promises she could not keep.


Mom, I'm scared of Ellie.


That image may be my last memory of you.


At that moment, Grace's gaze changed dramatically.


"Ellie...."


Grace crawled toward the violin case, dragging her weakened legs across the rough dirt path. Sharp pebbles and sand embedded themselves in her knees and shins, but she felt no pain. In her dazed mind, only one name echoed.

“Elli….”


The bag with the gun started to look like Ellie. She embraced the bag lying on the floor as if it were the person she loved most in the world.



No, you are the only person I truly love in the world.


"It's not a difficult thing, is it?"


It's not a difficult task.










It was a time well after the sun had risen, but due to the thick gray clouds, everything around was dark like dawn.


As the car reached the main gate of Winston, the guard, seeing the headlights, ran over and opened the door. The sedan, having finally exited the mansion, slowly drove down the empty road, cutting through the torrential rain that poured down like a deluge.



Campbell, sitting in the passenger seat, attempted to recite the day's schedule as he had done for several years but stopped. After all, the lieutenant colonel sitting in the back seat wouldn’t be listening.

Kill me.


But his messenger had no answer.


Yeah, you still want me to be unhappy. So you won't show me any mercy.


Grace did not keep her promise to call again. It’s pathetic that I believed a promise she made in passing and spent the whole day just waiting for the phone to ring, yet I am still waiting, even knowing that.

Still, before leaving, they would at least call once.


Perhaps it was a promise to make me hope like that, to wait forever in a hopeless expectation.


I shouldn't have said that Grace's torture methods were effective.


But this is right. I have to be unhappy forever.


He did not deserve any mercy from that woman. Before she someday gives me an order to die, I must endure the punishment imposed by Grace in this hell on earth. It was then that I was struggling against the impulse to press Grace's revolver under my chin and pull the trigger once again today.


Squeak.


The car that was gliding along suddenly came to a stop.


"Is she crazy…."


At the moment the driver muttered a curse, Leon's intuition sparked. As soon as he turned his gaze forward, life returned to his once-dead eyes.

A ghostly pale woman stood in the dazzling light of the headlights.


Leon burst through the door and stepped out into the pouring rain, approaching Grace without hesitation. At the moment he had just one step left, the hand that had been hidden behind her back appeared.

Both hands were holding submachine guns.


Seeing the woman aiming the gun at him, Leon gestured for Campbell not to come out. His gaze remained fixed on Grace's pale, frightened face.


“Is today my birthday? Or did Christmas come three months late?”
I started to laugh like a madman alone in the sharply pouring rain.


"That's right. Even I wouldn't choose myself."


He murmured with a twisted smile at the corners of his eyes, wondering what was so funny. The rainwater flowing down his face, hidden by the brim of his hat, made him appear as if he were crying.

"Is it possible to spare a little time to smoke a cigarette?"


The man did not wait for an answer and put his left hand inside the jacket of his uniform.


“Habits are terrifying. To carry something around that has no taste or scent.”


He took out a cigar and did something strange. Instead of putting it in his mouth, he raised it in front of his eyes. As he slowly rotated it as if drawing a symbol representing eternity in the air, the cigar became soaked through with rainwater.



"Do you remember Colonel Humphrey, who was once my superior?"





"He said that if you dampen a cigar with water before smoking it, the flavor deepens. I've smoked cigars soaked in whiskey or rum, but water… I laughed it off, but to be honest, I was curious about what it would taste like if soaked in water."



The man, having soaked the cigar until its outside became a deep brown, cut the end and put it in his mouth. With a click, a spark flew from the lighter. The hand that covered the end of the cigar to keep the rain from falling was more gaunt, the contours of the bones and tendons more pronounced than before.


After several attempts, the fire caught. The man took a deep drag on his cigar until his cheeks were sunken, then exhaled a long puff of white smoke. The smoke that spread into the light of the headlights quickly dissolved into the rain.



"Hmm... it's not as amazing in taste as they were going on about."


The cheap taste of the common people. The man looked down at the cigar pinched between his long fingers, squinting, then turned his gaze to Grace. The moment their eyes met, his expression shifted dramatically.

"Darling, have you come all this way to grant my last wish?"


I suddenly felt a sense of déjà vu.


"Babe, did you have a good last outing before you die?"



Grace looked at the man standing in the rain in his officer's uniform and recalled the dawn when she had tried to
It sounded like a reprimand to take responsibility for Ellie and raise her until the end. The moment my head inadvertently lowered, thick droplets mixed with the rain fell onto the barrel.

"Lastly, hell is now my territory, so don't even think about stepping foot here. I never want to see you again."


The two hands gripping the gun began to tremble uncontrollably.


"My will ends here."


The man threw the half-burned cigar onto the puddled road and strode over to Grace, extending his hand. I thought he was trying to grab the gun, but that wasn't the case. He disengaged the safety on the gun with his own hand and stepped back again.



"Fire."


The man closed his eyes.


Stop your nonsense.


Grace strained to hold back her laughter, but it didn't last long.


"Ah, please let me see your face so that I can keep the coffin open during the funeral."


"Madman, black…."


As soon as laughter burst forth, it turned into tears.


The one who was truly crazy was himself.


The moment his lips touched mine, I came to my senses as if waking from a dream.


Why am I here? Why am I aiming a gun at this man?


I was just listening to the man babbling in confusion. In the meantime, my mind gradually became clearer, and I realized what I was about to do.

I tried to kill the man who I had been worried might die while being captured by the rebels.


“That's right. I wouldn't choose myself either.”



“Lastly, hell is now my territory, so don't even think about stepping in. I never want to see you again.”
Once again, I hurt a man.
The shock of realizing that was more painful than when Nancy hit me in the head.
Clatter.
She threw the gun far away. Grace clasped her face with her trembling hands.
“Boohoo….”
All I can hear is the deafening sound of rain and my own sobs. The familiar footsteps did not sound.
I lowered my hand and faced the man. He opened his closed eyes and was gazing intently at Grace. The deeply
sunken eyes spoke.
Do I need you?
Okay.
I will no longer chase you, so come back.
Grace dragged his weakening legs as if to fall, burying his face in his milky chest.
"I'm sorry."
The man's two hands held her. As they roamed up her body, the hands that finally cupped her cheek were
trembling.
"Speak."
As the head was lifted upward, a distinctly shadowed face caught my eye. The eyes, which seemed unlike anything
human, burned with madness.
"What a little bastard."
Grace, watching the lips that spat out anger, held his cheek and pressed her lips against his. It was a kiss of
contract, not a kiss of death.
There are two ways to survive in hell: become a demon or make a pact with a demon.
"Is killing that devil cruel for you?"
Yes, because you are my demon.
